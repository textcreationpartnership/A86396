            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF THE <hi>PALAIS ROYAL,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>LEt us wave all City-Adventures, and the Formal Gallantries of the Town; we have now more illustrious and splendid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Entertainment: The <hi>King</hi> in his Throne of <hi>Love</hi> with as much Undaunted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as in his Seat of <hi>Justice.</hi> Let us then a little observe his <hi>Majesty;</hi> and if it be possible omit none of his Proceedings, nor the good Offices of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saint Agnan:</hi> whom for the future we shall call <hi>Duke-Mercury;</hi> as he who by his Care and Pains hath coupled our Gods in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150088:4"/> despite of the Jealousy of our Goddes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p>To begin then with a Faithful Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>King:</hi> He is Tall, some-what Broad-shoulder'd, has a Handsome Leg, Dances well, and very Dextrous in all Bodily Exercises: He has enough of the Meen and Port of a <hi>Monarch,</hi> Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brown Hair, and his Face a little marked with the Small-Pox: His Eyes are spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and sweet, his Lips red; And yet all this renders him not Beautiful. He is of a Prodigious Wit, and Admirable in his Carriage towards her he loves: So that one wou'd think, he reserves for such occasions the Vigor of his Mind, as well as that of his Body. And what convinces all men that his Wit is extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, he hath never given his Love to any but Persons of that Character. He hath acknowledged, that nothing in this Life does so sensibly affect him, as the Pleasures of Love; and that's his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. He is a little Rough, very Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous; of a haughty and a disdainful Humour; amongst Men given to Vanity, a little Envious, and were he not a <hi>King</hi> some what uneasie in Company. But on the other hand, He is Couragious, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150088:4"/> True, full of Honour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly Just to his Word; Grateful, of great Integrity; esteeming such as are so slighting those that are otherways: And in a word, constant in all his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.</p>
            <p>Though I have told you, his only Weakness is his too much Love for the Femal Sex, yet he never admired many Women. The first Passion he had, was for <hi>Mademoiselle de Manbhiny,</hi> a Lady of a low Stature, Ugly, and Fat, with the Air of an Hostess; but Witty as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, which covered all her Defects, and made her Company very delightful. She was in love with the <hi>King;</hi> and therefore some say He spent many plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Hours with her; insomuch, that <hi>Madama de Venel</hi> often surprized them, as they were preparing for greater Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: But we must tell the truth, their Joys never attained to a full accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>King</hi> wou'd have Marry'd her, had not the <hi>Cardinal</hi> opposed it; who was baited by the <hi>Queen-Mother.</hi> and made to promise one day when he beg'd some Marks of her Kindness, that he wou'd hinder the Business from taking effect. What I desire of you (said she)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150088:5"/> is no such great Proof of your Passion as you imagine; For, to be short, if the <hi>King</hi> Marry your Neece. he will certainly Divorce from her, and Banish you; And I swear to you, the latter of these Two will more perplex me, than the Marriage; though I see, my Designs for a Peace quite ruined, if the <hi>King</hi> Marry not the Daughter of <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> was out-witted, and promised what the <hi>Queen</hi> defired, that he might have what he expected; so true it is, that another Man's Business is none of ours. At this time, he shewed himself no <hi>Italian;</hi> For the <hi>King</hi> to this very day testifies an invincible Aversion to all Divorces, and declares it so often, that he gives good ground to beleive, he wou'd never have practised so base a thing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinal</hi> at length Marryed his Neece to the Constable <hi>Colona;</hi> The News of which so afflicted our <hi>King,</hi> that he wept, cry'd, cast himself at his feet, and called him <hi>Pa Pa.</hi> But in a word, it was the Fate of those Lovers, to be separated. That disconsolate Lady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to depart, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose stepping into her Coach, wittily said to her Lover, whom she perceiv'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150088:5"/> almost dead through Excess of Grief; <hi>You weep, you love me, you dispare, are a</hi> King, <hi>and notwithstanding, I am miserable, and must indeed be gone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Separation had like to have cost the <hi>King</hi> his Life; But he was Young, and at last took Comfort-again; though it wou'd not be so easy a matter now a dayes, to make him forget his Passion; For no man was ever more in Love, than now He is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mademoiselle de La Valliere</hi> is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Object of his Desires. She was a <hi>Maid of Honour</hi> to <hi>Madame;</hi> And though she be not after the order of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> yet excuse me from relating her Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogy. Her Person being the most illus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious Thing she can pretend to, I will only tell you by the by, that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Mombazom</hi> promised her Father to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him his Nobility, but he dyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Duke</hi> performed his Promise. His Widdow marry'd <hi>Monsieur de St. Remy.</hi> And in a word all that can be said, is, that <hi>La Valliere,</hi> who five years ago was no Gentlewoman, is at present as Noble as the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is somewhat now to be said of that person, which hath so strongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the heart of a proud and haughty
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150088:6"/>
               <hi>Prince:</hi> She is of a middle Stature, and very Slender: Her Gate not graceful, because she is Crooked: She is of a fair Complexion, and marked with the <hi>Small-Pox:</hi> Her eyes are brown, casting a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Look; but sometimes also, full of Life and Spirit: Her Mouth is large, with lips pretty red; bad Teeth, no Breasts, and flat Arms; which make Men judge disadvantagiously of the rest of her Body: She hath a sparkling Wit, full of Life and Vigour, speaks things pleasantly, has much Solidity, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also; For she is acquainted with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the Histories of the World, and has enough to Read them: Her Heart is great, steadfast, generous, void of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and tender; and without doubt, not unapt for Love. She is Faithful and Sincere, free from all frisking Levity; and of all Women living, most capable of a great Engagement. She loves her Friends extreamly; and it is certain She loved the <hi>King</hi> above a Year before he was acquainted with it; and that she often told a Friend of hers, That she wished he had not been of so high a Rank and Quality. It is well known to all that the Sport they made of it at Court,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150088:6"/> stir'd up a Curiosity in the <hi>King</hi> to know her; and as it is natural to Generous Souls, to Love those who Love them; the <hi>King</hi> from that time had a Kindness for her; not that her Person pleased him, for his Passion was but Gratitude, and so he told the <hi>Count <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Guich,</hi> that he would marry her to a <hi>Marquess</hi> whom he named, and a Friend of the <hi>Counts;</hi> which made him reply to the <hi>King,</hi> That his Friend loved handsom Women. Ha! Good <hi>God</hi> (said the <hi>King</hi>) it is true, she is not Beautiful, but I will do for her so, as to make her Desirable.</p>
            <p>Three Dayes after, the <hi>King</hi> went to visit <hi>Madame,</hi> who was ill; and staid with <hi>La Valliere</hi> in the Anti-Chamber, with whom he entertained a long Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; and was so charmed with her Wit, that from that minute his Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude was turned into real Love. He made no stay with <hi>Madame,</hi> but returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the next day; and so continued for the Space of a Month; which gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a Rumour that he was in love with <hi>Madame,</hi> and her self also to beleive it. But the <hi>King</hi> sought only an opportunity to discover his Love which much prest him; and he might have easily found it,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150088:7"/> had he considered only his Quality of <hi>King;</hi> But he looked more on that of a Lover; And in effect he appeared so timorous and bashful that he thereby made a full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of Heart, which he had already sufficiently wounded.</p>
            <p>Walking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e day in the Park of <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selles,</hi> he complained that for Ten or Twelve Days, he found himself out of order: <hi>Mademoiselle de La Valliere</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared much concerned, and testifyed her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> trouble with a great deal of Tenderness. Alas! <hi>Mademoiselle</hi> (said he) how Good you are, to concern your self in the Health of a wretched <hi>Prince,</hi> who has not deserved from you the least Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, were it not that he is altogether at your Devotion. Yes, <hi>Madame</hi> (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, in a disorder that charmed the Fair One) You are the absolute Mistriss of my Life, my Death and Repose: and my Fortune depends wholly on you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>La Valliere</hi> blush't, and was so out of Countenance, that she remained Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less: She saw at her Knees a great <hi>King,</hi> whom She loved, melting in Passion; which could not but put her to Plunge. What is the Cause of that Silence, <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiselle,</hi> (continued he?) Ah! It is an
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150088:7"/> Effect of your insensibility, and my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness. You are not so tender, as you seem to be, and if so, how much am I to be pittyed, for Adoring you at the rate I do? No Sir (replyed she) I am not insensible of what you feel for my sake; My Heart shall make you a Return, if in reality you Love me: But also, if it be because I have been exposed in your Court, by reason of the particular Esteem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

(replyed the <hi>King</hi> in great trouble) enough, enough; I have no more to say: but that I am the most unfortunate of all Men living. Can therebe a man so mean, that does not revenge his Mistrisses Quarrel, and I cannot do it? You are in the right: The <hi>Queens</hi> will fall foul on that poor Lady; and hereafter, make it their business to

No, I correct my self; for so long as my <hi>Dear Prince</hi> loves me I cannot be Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate: Nothing can afflict me, but the loss of him.

The <hi>Queen</hi> was so touched at this, that she threw her self at the <hi>King</hi>'s Feet, who was walking in her Chamber. Well, <hi>Madame</hi> (said he) what would you say?

               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:150088:22"/> in me? Do not you credit my Words as your own Eyes? There is nothing more certain, (answered <hi>La Valliere</hi>) than that I believe you have much Vertue: Ah! if it be possible, my dear Prince, have as much Love; for in short, I now declare to you, that it is easie for me to dye, but that it is impossible for me to shake off an Engagement so powerful as yours; and that I had rather renounce to live, than to be without the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hopes that you have given me: Love me then, for if you give over, I well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that after the Loss of your Heart, my Life will seem tedious to me. What a baseness would it be, (cryed the King, embracing her Knees!) if having heard what now I hear, any but you should ever get Possession of my Heart. So ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving assured her of an Eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, he bid her farewel till next Day.</p>
            <p>About this time it was (as I told you) when the King spent almost whole Nights with her, never leaving her until Three of the Clock; that one Night, just as he was gone, and she began to fall asleep, her little Dog awakened her by his Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and she hearing a Noise at her Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150088:23"/> and the Tread of Feet in her Chamber, fled into her Maids Room: All the People of the House saw the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Cord, which made so great a Noise next Morning, that it came to the King's Ears, and he immediately went to her, that he might learn the Truth of the Matter. So soon as he had it from her own Mouth, he was strangely troubled; and the same Week appointed her Guards, and a Steward of her House, who was to taste of every thing she should Eat. Every one discanted on this according to their Humor; but the Wiser knew from whence the Bolt was shot. Since that Accident the King's Love has daily increased, and the fear of losing her has made him many times grow Pale in Company. <hi>Madame,</hi> who is not altogether of that Temper, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued her Diversions, tho' the Count of <hi>Guiche</hi> was absent: One Day when she was discoursing with the King, she endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured again to wheadle him; for pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Handkerchief out of her Pocket, she dropt a Letter written by <hi>Monsieur de Vardes,</hi> which gave a Positive Account of the whole Letter that was written to the <hi>Signora Molina,</hi> concerning the King's
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150088:23"/> Love for <hi>La Ʋalliere,</hi> and wherein (as it was his Custom) he called him Young <hi>Bragadocio:</hi> Never was man more sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized than the <hi>King</hi> was: And finding that <hi>de Vardes,</hi> in whom he confided, was a complice in the trick. he spoke of it to <hi>Madame</hi> without passion, but with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Grief, which gave sufficient evidence of his good disposition: She who valued nothing, provided she could justify the <hi>Count de Guiche</hi> frankly confessed to the <hi>King</hi> the whole intriegue of the Countess of <hi>Soissons</hi> and <hi>de Vardes:</hi> the <hi>King</hi> sent for <hi>de Ʋardes,</hi> and having bitterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him for his infidelity, banished him. The Trouble that Madame <hi>de Sois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> was in, cannot be exprest, when she came to know this News, which <hi>de Vardes</hi> informed her of by this Letter.</p>

            <p>The <hi>King</hi> at night in his Closet, calling to mind that Conversation, said openly, that he could not indure those Creatures who having loved with all imaginable liberty themselves, will needs censure the Actions of others; and because Pleasures forsake them, they are mad that any should be in a condition of Enjoyments; when we are weary of Loving and Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we shall speak as they do. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (said he) <hi>Madame de Chevreuse,</hi> Can any thing be bolder, than that that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnn should speak against Gallantry? A Dutches of <hi>Eguilon</hi> also a Princess of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignan,</hi> and generally all the Ladies at <hi>Court,</hi> are much the same. Then tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning towards <hi>Roquelaure,</hi> In good Faith (continued he) Gallantry hath alwayes been, and will ever be: Those that are not talked of, are either more secret in their
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:150088:25"/> Affairs, or mannage them with some base and insignificant fellow, or, in a word, are so silly, that no Body minds them. The <hi>King</hi> being in a good Humour, had a little Fling at all our Ladies; he spoke of <hi>Madame de Chastillon,</hi> and the <hi>Prince, Madame de Luines,</hi> with the President <hi>Tambonneau,</hi> the Princess of <hi>Monacco,</hi> with <hi>Pegelin,</hi> the Ladies of <hi>Angoulesme, Vitry, Valeutinois, Ʋienne, Soubize,</hi> and <hi>Brezy;</hi> with their Beloved <hi>Feuillade, de Ʋivonne, le Teleiere</hi> and <hi>Humieres;</hi> and heartily Laughed at all.</p>
            <p>Next a day troublesome accident chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Joy into Grief; for being with his Mistress as Fine and Lovely as an <hi>Adonis</hi> and engaged in a concern wherein a third Party is never admitted, the poor Soul was taken with that distemper, which makes Women cry out so much, and that with so much Violence, and terrible Fits, that never was Man in more Perplexity, than our <hi>Monarch.</hi> All in disorder he called out at the Windows for help, and bid in all hast, call the Ladies <hi>Montauzier,</hi> and <hi>de Choisi,</hi> whil'st a Maid of <hi>La Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licres</hi> ran for the common Mid-Wife; but all came too late, to save the most stately Vest that ever was, (being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150088:26"/> and set with Diamonds and Pearls) from carrying of same marks of the disorder. The Ladies upon their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival found the <hi>King</hi> sweating like an <hi>Ox▪</hi> having supported <hi>La Valliere</hi> in her pains; who was so cruel as to make him tear a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Whisk worth a thousand Crowns, whilst she hung a bout his Neck. She could suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no other hands to come near her, but those that are appointed for the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Scepters and Crowns. In a word, in this Juncture, the <hi>King</hi> did Things, if not beseeming and neat, at least very passionate. It is certain, that he was like to Dye, (when▪ <hi>Madame de Choisi</hi> cryed like a Fool) she is dead; <hi>Madame de Mountauzier</hi> beleived it also; for she sounded a away in a violent fit. In the Name of God (cryed the <hi>King</hi> bath'd in tears, restore me <hi>La Ʋalliere</hi> and take all that I have! He was upon his knees at the foot of the Bed, immoveable as a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, unless now and then, when he made such Lamentable and Heavy out-cries, that the Ladies and Physicians seem'd drowned in tears: at length she came to her self again, and looking about her for the <hi>King, Madame de Mountazier</hi> desired him draw near the Bed: She squeezed his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150088:26"/> hand; but with so much weakness, that the <hi>Kings</hi> Grief increasing, they were fain to pull him from her, and lay him on a Bed.</p>
            <p>It was a little Boy that gave so much Trouble to our Master: Which was quickly mitigated by the Soveraign Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines that were administred by the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians. So soon as she was a little eased of her pains she asked <hi>Madame de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauzeir;</hi> What she thought of the <hi>King</hi>'s Love? but in such a manner as being her self ravished therewith. <hi>Madame de Mountauzier,</hi> who was indeed surprized at what she had seen, told her sincerely, That one could not have too much love for a Prince, who loved so passionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>It cannot be expressed, how Affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately he thanked our Ladies; assuring them, that he should make Royal acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments, for the Service they had then done him: And in truth it is well seen, that he hath been as good as his Word. <hi>La Valliere</hi> cannot have too great an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of the Marks that the <hi>King</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her of his love; it being certain that his heart is naturally so dilicate, that he cannot endure the impurities of a Child-Bed;

               </gap> Nevertheless he was constantly nailed to <hi>La Vallieres</hi> Beds-Head, and with his own Hands gave her Broths, and did often eat in her presence. But for all the Care and Pains he was pleased to take, his fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>La Valliere</hi> is certainly the object of that great passion which will alwaies ravish the Heart and Soul of the <hi>King;</hi> all others being but sudden flashes, designed only for the satisfaction of his body, and to expire with the enjoyment.

            <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Count</hi> hath written to his Father, beseeching him to employ his interest, to procure the places that were his, to be conferred upon his Brother the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Lovigny:</hi> That he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This my Dear (said she to the <hi>Dutchess</hi>) is my opinion of all Men in general: Not that I doubt, but that there are some seceret Familiarities, where one may find fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Constancy. Ha! <hi>Madame</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the <hi>Dutchess</hi>) you are much in the right: There are some happy people in the World, who make no noise nor desire any other Witnesses of their Integrity than themselves; and without doubt that is the Greatest. But I profess I cannot be perswaded that Love which marches with Drums beating, and Colours flying, can be passionate and sincere, no certainly it never is. Men have a kind of pride to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip their Rivals; and it is Vanity that makes Ladies retain their Slaves: They would be extreamly vexed if it were not talked of at Court, That <hi>Monsieur</hi> the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:150088:29"/>
               <hi>Duke, Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Count, Monsieur le Chevalier,</hi> is in love with <hi>Madame</hi> such a one: They are much more taken with the Pomp and Expence, than with Sighs and tears; so that it is no wonder, if such commerce break up: For as Handsom Women are every where to be found, so Men recover as fast as they lose. But <hi>Madame,</hi> it is not so easy to find Ladies of clear Understanding, who are above Trifles, who have a tender and delicate Heart, and only love their Gallants for their Virtue, Love, and Fidelity. Never, (interrupted <hi>Madame</hi>) never did I so well before conceive the Pleasures of a Secret Love: And indeed, <hi>Dutches,</hi> I perceive that our Lovely <hi>Legate</hi> hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired into you a wise and discerning Heart; you shall tell me some Particulars of that at S. <hi>Clou,</hi> where I shall intreat your Company for some Days. She promised to do so, and parted on these terms.</p>
            <p>Let us return to the <hi>King,</hi> who talks more at ease than these Ladies, of the Delight he takes in Loving, and in being Beloved.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of St. <hi>Agnan,</hi> and <hi>Madame de Montauzeir,</hi> those he entertained, when upon a debate arising betwixt the Duke
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:150088:30"/> Lady, eoncerning the effects of a prompt inclination; The <hi>King,</hi> to shew either his Wit, or his Memory, I know not which; but it is certain, that he wrote in a Table-Book, and shewed these Four Lines.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>How little is true, what some beleive,</l>
               <l>That Hearts at the first sight, do Love conceive.</l>
               <l>And yet these Flames are kindled by a Glance,</l>
               <l>That after to the greatest Heights advance.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>It is to be well considered how Divine and Ravshing this is. He would have <hi>Madame de Mountauzeir,</hi> who does what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleases, write likewise something concerning her Love, she declined it as much as she could, but at length made these following Lines upon what the <hi>King</hi> said, that he was resolved to satisfy his own Heart; and that he Laughed at those who spent their Life in censuring the Actions of others.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Those tender Sentiments, can any blame,</l>
               <l>That now your Heart to gentle Love do frame?</l>

               <l>Since all Men know, Love's soft yet noble Heat.</l>

               <l>Love in a <hi>Monarch</hi> greatly I esteem,</l>
               <l>And think a Quality so worthy him.</l>
               <l>That where 'tis wanting one may all Things fear,</l>
               <l>As one may all Things hope, if Leve appear.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> returned the Praises that <hi>Madame de Montauzier</hi> had given him, and obliged the Duke also to employ his Muse; which indited to him these Verses.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Madame de Mountauzier</hi> had more Wit than to neglect so fair an occasion of making her Court to the <hi>King:</hi> She told him that his Joy was imperfect, if <hi>La Valliere</hi> saw not little poetical Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation: The <hi>King</hi> liked it well, and thought fit to puzzle her in sending it by an unknown Hand, which they did; and there-to she added what follows.</p>

I understand what you would say (replyed the <hi>King,</hi> with extream passion;) yes I know that I shall never find in any, those Divine Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters that have charmed my heart; that I shall never find in any but your self, that admirable and ravishing Wit, which can render ones Life Happy and Pleasant with you in the Solitude of remotest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts. Wrong not then, by your Unjust Suspicions a Prince who adores you; and beleive, that I shall never find in any that Heart that I esteem so much, and on the Fidelity whereof, I wholly rely. I fancy there is none but it, that can Love as I desire to be Beloved. What Trouble should I have to discern whether those

Think with yourself then if knowing your sentiments to be so Virtuous and Heroick, I can ever change for the Beauty of some Faces, which the least Fit of Sickness can destroy. No, no, <hi>Madame;</hi> imagine not that it was the Lustre of your Complexion, or the Spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of your Eyes, that hath Charmed me; you gained me by your lovely Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and shall never lose me whil'st I enjoy Life. In a word it was the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of your Soul, your Wit, and Heart, which have fettered my Liberty, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged me to your Devotion. How Good you are, my Dear Prince (replyed she) to employ the force of your eloquence to assure a Heart whose too much fear
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:150088:32"/> proceeds only from too much love! How happy am I that I love a Prince who sees so clearly into my Heart: Yes (continued she, embracing him) you have reason to beleive, that I was not dazled with your greatness, that I had no regard to yout Crown when I loved you; and that your Person alone was the the object of my desires, it is beleive me to amiable to stand in need of Thrones and Scepters, to add to its Worth, and would to God, I had a Thousand Times said to my self, that my Dear Prince had no other Fortune and Estate, but what his Virtue hath entailed upon him, and that I might with him spend my life in a private Condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from Court and Grandure; but love has not long suffered me to make so unjust a Wish.

            <p>Next Morning she wrote to the <hi>King</hi> an account of all that Adventure: And about Two of the Clock came to my Lodgings where he discours'd almost an Hour with her. He offered to have removed her from me that very day (but she would not) he
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:150088:39"/> gave the Pendants and Watch you know of; and desired her that adorned with them, she should come into my Chamber, which she did. I ask't her before the <hi>King</hi> who had bestowed those Things on her: I did (said the <hi>King,</hi> with little Civility) at this I stood speechless; but the <hi>King</hi> having pray'd me to go to <hi>Varsailles,</hi> and take that Creature along with me, I took no notice of it at that time, till I might have the opportunity of doing it before the <hi>Queens.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> without doubt su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected as much, for that day he did us all the civility, to leave us in the Vain that then fell, and took <hi>La Villiere</hi> by the hand, covering her Head with his Hat. Thus slighting our dsiegns he, made no secret of an intrigue, whereof we inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make a Mysterious Point.</p>
            <p>Judge then after all this, my Dear, how great my obligations are to the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutchess</hi> condoled with her; and after they had spent Five or Six dayes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing of their several affairs, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again to <hi>Paris.</hi>

               <hi>Madame</hi> Sup't at <hi>Louvre,</hi> where she found almost all the Ladies of the Court, who came to Visit the <hi>Queen-Mother,</hi> then a little indisposed. The <hi>King</hi> perceiving <hi>Monsieur de Rocqueluar</hi> come in, ask't him if his roguery with Woman-kind must
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:150088:40"/> be always the subject of discourse.

               </gap>en slighting of them, does no way please me: Who can countenance a Man, that wants sincerity towards them? For in short is there nothing to be feared, because that all that they can do, is to persecute us but with Tears and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining? That is barbarous: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, who ever is honest in one Point, should be so in all. In reallity (replyed the first and most beautiful <hi>Dutchess</hi> of <hi>France</hi>) it is a great Honour for us, that such a <hi>King</hi> as ours does so generously maintain our Cause. Ha! <hi>Madame</hi> (said the <hi>King</hi>) I should not need to do so, were all Ladies like you. After all (said the <hi>Queen) Monsieur de Guiche</hi> lost himself so much Two or Three passages of that Nature, that not a Semptress in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change would have trusted him, tho he were dead. But <hi>Madame</hi> (said <hi>Rocquelaur</hi> to her smilling) when a Confessour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to break off? Ah!

            <p>Afterward he went to prepare for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession next Day, which he made with wonderful Devotion, and divided the day into three Parts; one for God ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the People, and a third for <hi>La Valliere,</hi> to whom he gave his richest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents; amongst which none pleased me more than a set of Christial-Furniture rarely wrought.

            <p>Next Week the two Lovers went by themselves to <hi>Versailes, Mademoiselle d' Artigny</hi> not being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to go with them; So true it is that Secrecy is the delight of Love, this puts me in mind of the Cardinal-Legate, who one day said to <hi>Monsieur de Crequi; Parbleu Monsieur,</hi> I should lose one half of my Pleasure if I thought any Body heard me.</p>

            <p>They staid seven or eight dayes at <hi>Versailles,</hi> where they diverted themselves at Hunting, Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in Bed, and at all other recreations they pleased.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:150088:41"/>
            <p>As they were returning to <hi>Paris Mademoiselle de La Valliere</hi> fell from her horse, which would not have hurt her much had she not been the Kings Mistress; but because of that she must needs be let blood; and I know not why she would have <hi>Oppier</hi> to be the Man: The King who would be present did more hurt than good; for he made such a noise in the Surgeons ears, that for fear he twice mist of his hit. Her Lover grew pale as a Linn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The King cast himself into his place, and held the Foot of that rare one, till another Surgeon came, who pluck't out the point of that Launcet, and her let blood extreamly well; tho for all that she was fain to keep her bed for a Month after.</p>
            <p>The King for her sake put off his Journey to Fountainblau, for the space of Ten Dayes; but must then be gone. She had every day News from the King, and the King from her. This is one of the Letters which she wrote to him.</p>

            <p>An Hour after this Letter was dispatched, the King was so impatient of seeing his Mistress, that he prayed the Duke of St. <hi>Agnan</hi> to go for her, not being able himself, because of some impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Affairs, that were then in agitation in his Councel. The Duke immediately departed, and two dayes after our two lovers tasted the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of beholding one another, after a short Absence their joy was great, but the Queens was not so; who without this, had Vexation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to hear the King almost every night dream, and talk aloud of that little <hi>Pute</hi>—(for so he called her, speaking not good French.)

One of the first who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himself was <hi>Beuvron,</hi> whom the Neighbourhood of Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> gave the more conveniency of seeing; and by this means loved her a pretty while without being discovered; and I fancy this Amour would have still been concealed, if <hi>Beuvron</hi> had never had Rivals: But the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> being fallen in love with Madam <hi>d'Olonne,</hi> quickly perceived what had thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto remained concealed for want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed People: Not but that <hi>d' Olonne</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:150088:44"/> loved his Wife extreamly, but Husbands are stupid, and so are never Lovers, and the jealousie of these is much more piercing than that of the others: So that the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> saw things that <hi>d'Olonne</hi> did not, and never has seen, for he is still ignorant that <hi>Beuvron</hi> has had an Intrigue with his Wife.</p>

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> had blew Eyes, a handsome Nose, irregular Features, a great and disagreeable Mouth, but very fine Teeth, light yellowish Hair both long and thick, his Shape was admirable, and he dressed so well, that the greatest Spar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This Letter which grateful People would have thought very kind, did not seem so to the Duke of <hi>Candale;</hi> As he was very vain, he had expected less intricate Favours: and this obliged him not to press Madam <hi>d' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne</hi> so much as she was willing he should have done, and made her a hard task in spight of her self; and the thing had lasted a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150088:46"/> long time, if the Fair One had not gained upon her Modesty to make him so many advances, that he fancyed he might make an attack without being exposed to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse. The business being done, he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceived <hi>Beuvron</hi>'s Commerce. Usually a Pretender looks only before him, but a Lover well treated, looks on the right and on the left, and is not long without discovering his Rival: Hereupon the Duke complaines; His Mistress calls him Caprichious and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and takes him up so roundly, that he asks her pardon for his suspicions, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies himself too happy in having appeased her. This Calm did not long continue, <hi>Beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vron</hi> for his part reproached her to as little purpose as the Duke did, and seeing he could not destroy his Rival himself, he caused notice to be given under hand to <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne</hi> that his Wife entertained the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> for her Galant. <hi>D' Olonne</hi> forbids her to see him, that is to say, redoubled the Passion of those two Lovers, who having the more desire to see one another since it was forbidden, found a thousand more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient oppurtunities than those they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; However <hi>Beuvron</hi> remaining Master of the field of Battails, the Duke of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> renewed his Complaints against him,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150088:47"/> and used all his endeavours to have him Cashiered, but all to no purpose; Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> told him that she perceived he only considered his own Interest, and that he cared not if he ruined her, since that if she should forbid <hi>Beuvron</hi> to see her, her husband and all the world would not doubt but that she made that sacrifice to him; Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> did not love <hi>Beuvron</hi> so much as she did the Duke, yet she was not willing however to lose him, and as well because One and One make Two, as that because Cocquetts fancy they can retaine their Galants better by a little Jealousy than a great Tranquility.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Paget</hi> a man pretty well stricken in years, meanly born, but very rich, fell in love with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and having discovered that she loved the sport, he fancyed that his Money would serve him instead of Merit, and founded his greatest hopes upon the sum he resolved to offer her; He had access enough to her house to have spoke to her himself, if he had durst; but he had not the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to begin a discourse, which might be of ill consequence if it was not kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, so that he thought the best course would be to write to her, which he did in these termes.</p>

               <hi>Paget</hi> did not fail to be at the Assignation, and went thither in a Habit, that is to say, with his Bag and the appurtenances. <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> having introduced him into her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150088:48"/> Closet, left them together: <hi>See here, Madam,</hi> said he to her, shewing what he brought, <hi>this is what is not daily met with: will you receive it? I am willing,</hi> said Madam <hi>d' Olonne, and it will help to amuse us.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon having counted the two Thousand broad Pieces they had agreed for, she shut them up in a little Trunk, and placing her self by them upon a little Couch, which did not last her long, <hi>Sir,</hi> said she to him, <hi>there is not a Man in</hi> France <hi>wrights like you; what I am going to say, is not to shew my self a Critick, but it is certain that I find but few people that have so much Wit as you have. Most men enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain us only with Fopperies, and when they would write to us kind Letters, they think they have done Miracles in telling us that they adore us, that they shall dye if we do not Love them, and that if we will be so gracious to them, they will serve us as long as they live: we have much need in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of their Services. I am overioyed,</hi> said <hi>Paget, that my Letters please you; I should not say this elsewhere, but to you, Madam, I shall not mince the matter, my Letters cost me nothing. This is hard to be beleived,</hi> answered <hi>she, you must then have a very great Stock.</hi> After some other Discourses, which Love interrupted two or thre times, they agreed of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Interview, and at that of another: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150088:48"/> that those two thousand Broad Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces procured <hi>Paget</hi> three Assignations.</p>
            <p>But Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> being willing to make advantage of the Love of this Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, and of his Riches, desired him at the fourth Visit to begin again to write to her such Letters of Gallantry as that she had received from him: But he seeing that this would come to be of Consequence, he fell to reproaching her, which did him no good; and all that he could obtain was, that he should not be drove from her House, and that he might come and play when she should send for him.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> fancied that by letting <hi>Paget</hi> see her, she should in flame his desires, and that perhaps he would be again so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as to satisfie them at any rate; but tho he was so much in love as not to be able to forbear seeing her, yet he was not charmed to the degree of buying her Favours dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>Things being in these terms, whether spight made <hi>Paget</hi> blab, or that his frequent Visits and the Money that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> had played away, caused the Duke of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> to make reflexions, he desired his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, when he departed for <hi>Catalonia,</hi> not to see <hi>Paget</hi> any more, whose Commerce

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> was so fully assured by this Letter, that he resolved not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn his Mistris any more upon appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which he judged to be all deceitful. And for having been, as he thought, without reason suspicious, he fell into the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Confidence, and took in good part all the Cocquetry and Infidelity that Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> committed for six Months together; for she continued to see <hi>Paget,</hi> and to give Favours to <hi>Beuvron;</hi> and tho the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> had notice given him of it from several parts, he fancied that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from his Father or his Frinds, who were desirous to divert him from loving Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> believing that this Passion would hinder him from thinking of Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:150088:50"/>
            <p>So that he returned from the Army more in love than he had ever been▪ Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> likewise, with whom so long an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence made the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> passe for a new Galant, redoubled her eagerness for him, even in the sight of all the Court; this Lover took the Imprudences she committed to see him, for marks of a passion she was no longer Mistriss of, tho they were only Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the natural Irregularity of her reason; when she did any Passionate act that made a Noise, he thought her deeply in love and yet she was only silly. And he was so perswaded of the kindness she had for him, that tho he should dye for her sake, he apprehended he should be still ungrateful.</p>
            <p>It is easy to imagine that the Carriage of these Lovers made a great Noise; they had both of them Enemies; but the Fortune of the One and the Beauty of the Other made a great many envy them: tho all the world would have served them, they would have destroyed all by their Imprudence, and all the world would have done them hurt: They made Assignations every where, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having taken any measures with any Body. They saw One another often in a house, that the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> kept in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150088:50"/> the name of a Country Lady whom Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> pretended to visit most commonly by night at her own House▪ all these Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouzes did not take up all the time of this perfidious One, for when the Duke left her she went to the conquest of some new Lover, or at least to reassume <hi>Beuvron</hi> by a thousand kindnesses for the fears the Duke gave him.</p>
            <p>The Winter passed thus without the Duke of <hi>Candales</hi> suspecting the least ill in all she did, and he left her to return to the Army as well satisfied as he had ever been: he had not been there two Months but that he learnt news which troubled his joy: His par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friends who took strict notice of his Mistresses Conduct did not dare to say any thing to him as long as they found him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed by that faithless One; but something very extraordinary having hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened since his absence, and not fearing a sight of her should destroy the impressions they would give him, they altogether hazarded, without making appear any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign or concert, to acquaint him with her behaviour. Whereupon they each of them singly sent him word that <hi>Ieannin</hi> was deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged with Madam <hi>d'Olonne,</hi> that his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150088:51"/> assiduities gave cause to believe, not only a design, but a happy success; and in a word, that tho she were not culpable, he ought not to be satisfied with her, seeing she was suspected by all People.</p>
            <p>But while these News are going to put the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> in a rage, it is fit I should speak of the birth, progress, and ends <hi>Jeannin</hi>'s Passion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeannin de Castille</hi> was well shaped, had a pleasing Countenance, was very spruce, but had little Wit; his Quality and Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion were the same that <hi>Pagets,</hi> and was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich as well as he. He was handsome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have it believed that in case he had worn a Sword, his Merit alone might have procured him the Ladies Favours, but his Profession and his Riches made it suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that all the Women he had had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues with, were interessed, insomuch that when he was seen to be in love with Mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e would be beloved for his Money.</p>
            <p>The King after having passed the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers upon the Frontiers, usually returned to <hi>Paris</hi> in the Winters, and all the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements of the World possessed his Mind by turns; Billiards, Tennis, Hunting, Plays, and Dancing had each their times
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150088:51"/> with him: At that time Lotteries were so much the mode, that every one had them; some of Money, others of Jewels and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veables. Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> resolved to have One of Money; but whereas in the most part of them all the Cash was employed they had received, and that Fortune shared it, in this, which was of Ten thousand Crowns, there was not Five employed, and those Five too were distributed according as Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> thought fit. <hi>Jeannin</hi> was present when she made the first Proposals of the Lottery, and as she asked a Sum of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one according to their Abilities, and that she told him he was to give an Hundred pound, he made Answer, That he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and moreover promised her to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure amongst his Friends wherewith to make it up a Thousand. Presently after, all the Company being gone except <hi>Jean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin, I know not, Madam,</hi> said he to her, <hi>whether you are yet acquainted with my Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for I have loved you a long time, and my sighs already mount to a very great sum; but after having given my self entirely to you, I must needs ask the confirmation of my Bail, which I beseech you to sign, Madam; and observe, that besides the Hundred pound you taxed me, I give you Nine hundred more for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150088:52"/> the having your Affection; for what I said of my Friends was only to deceive the People that were here when I spoke to you of this Affair. I confess, Sir,</hi> answered Madam <hi>d' Olonne, I never thought you in love till now, not but that I have observed by certain Meenes in you, what made me suspect some things, but I am so disgusted with those kind of ways, and sighs and languishings are in my mind so poor a Galantry, and such feeble Testimonies of love, that if you had not taken a more gentile Course with me, you had lost your pains all your life time.</hi> Now as for Acknowledgment, you may believe that People are not far from loving, when we are well assured of being beloved: There need no more to make <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annin</hi> believe that he was at the Critical Minute. He cast himself at Madam <hi>d'O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne</hi>'s feet, and as he would have made use of that Action of Humility for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to higher Enterprizes, <hi>No,</hi> said she, <hi>you are mistaken, Sir; In what Country have you heard say that Women make Advances? When you shall have given me reall marks of a great Passion, I shall not be ungrateful. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annin,</hi> seeing that with her, Money was to be delivered before the Commodity, told her, That he had two Hundred broad Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that he would give them her if she
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150088:52"/> pleased: She consented, and having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them; <hi>If you think fit, Madam,</hi> said he to her, <hi>to grant me some favour upon the account of this Money, you will extreamly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me; or if you will stay till you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the whole Sum, give me a Note under your Hand of the value received.</hi> She chose rather to kiss than write▪ and a Moment after <hi>Jeannin</hi> went away, assuring her that he would bring the rest on the morrow, which he did not fail to do; and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was no sooner counted, then that she kept her word with him with all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that can be expected in such a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Tho <hi>Jeannin▪</hi> came in through the same Door that <hi>Paget</hi> did, she used him much better; whether she hoped to draw greater Advantages from him at length, or that he had some concealed Merit that served him instead of Liberality; she did not ask him new Proofs of Love for the giving him new Favours. The Thousand pounds made her love him three Months together, that is to say, treated him as if she had loved him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> having received Advice of his Mistresses new Intrigues, he wrote her this Letter.</p>

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> wrote this Letter just as he was upon returning to Court; he had newly lost a Battail, which did not a little contribute to the bitterness of his Letter: He could not suffer being beaten every where, and it would have been some Comfort to him in the Misfortunes of the War, if he had been more happy in Love. So that he began his Journey under a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

If you were capable of any tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150088:54"/> you could not see me in the Condition I am in, without dying for grief: But God be thanked, Nature has done the business, and since you could daily torment the Man of the World who loved you the most, you may well see him die without being concerned.</hi>

            <p>The first Letter that the Duke of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> wrote to Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> about <hi>Jean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin,</hi> had made her so much affraid of his Return, that she dreaded it like Death, and I fancy she wished she might never see him more. And yet the rumour of his being in that Extremity grieved her to the heart, and the News of his Death, which her Friend the Countess of <hi>Fiesque</hi> brought her, had like to have made her dye her self. She lost her Senses for some moments, and came only to herself at the Name of <hi>Merillus,</hi> whom she was told asked to speak with her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Merille</hi> was the Duke's principal Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and brought Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> the Letter from his Master that he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to her as he lay a dying, and the little Trunk wherein he put his Letters, and all the other Favours he had received from her. After having read this last Letter, she fell
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150088:54"/> a Crying more bitterly than before. The Countess not being willing to leave her in so deplorable Condition, proposed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening that Trunck for the amusing her grief. The Countess found at first a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief stained with blood in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Ah! my God,</hi> cryed Madam <hi>d' Olonne, how has that poor Man, who had so many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of greater Consequence, kept this Handkerchief till now; is there any thing in the world so kind!</hi> And thereupon she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Countess, that having cut her Finger as she was working by him some years ago, he had asked that Handkerchief of her, with which she had wiped her hand, and had kept it ever since. After that they found Bracelets, Purses, Hair and Pictures of Madam <hi>d' Olonne;</hi> and coming to the Letters, the Countess desired her Friend that she might read some of them. Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> having given her Consent, the Countess opened this first.</p>

               <hi>Is it true,</hi> Merille, said the Countess, <hi>that the Duke of</hi> Candale <hi>was in love with Madam</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:150088:56"/> de Castillanne? <hi>No, No, Madam,</hi> said he to her, <hi>he was two days in</hi> Avignon <hi>at his return from the Army, to refresh himself, and there he made two Visits to Madam</hi> de Castel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanne; <hi>judge if this can be called Love.

Alas!</hi> answered she, <hi>I only know the publick report; but it is so common, that this Amour is even said to be partly Cause of his Death:</hi> And then she fell a crying again more than ever.

            <p>By these Normans the Steward meant <hi>Beuvron</hi> and his Brothers, <hi>Jarry</hi> and the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>de Sainct Earemond,</hi> and the Abbot <hi>de Villerceaux,</hi> who were very assiduous at Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s House. The plainness with which this poor Man sent this News to the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> did so move that foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Woman, that after having looked upon the Countess to see how she took it, she burst out a laughing; the Countess not having so much reason to be afflicted as she had, did the like: But poor <hi>Merille</hi> not being able to bear with so unreasonable a Joy, redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Fears, and went out of the Cabinet in a pet. Two or three days after Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> being perfectly comforted, the Countess and her other Friends ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised her to mourn for her Honours sake, her Intrigue with the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been too publick, to make a Mystery of it: So that she constrained her self four or five days, after which she followed her old Course, and that which hastened her laying by her Mask of Mourning was the Carneval, which by giving her an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to satisfie her Inclination, helped her likewise to content her Husband, who had great suspicions of her Correspondence with the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> and thought
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150088:57"/> himself very happy in being freed from him. Wherefore to make him believe she was no longer concerned, she masked herself four or five times with him, and being willing to regain entirely his Confidence by a great sincerity, she not only confessed to him her love for the Duke, not only that she had suffered the Fort to be taken, but the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of their Enjoyments: And as she specified the number, <hi>He had but little lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>She had left her Bed but a week, which she had kept above four, by reason of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> great hurt she had in her leg, when she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to mask herself. And this desire advanced her Cure more then all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies she had used of a long time: So that she went in Masquerade four or five times with her Husband; but as these were only little private Masquerades, she resolved to have a great and famous One that might be talked of; and to that intent she, and three more, disguised themselves like Capuchins, and caused two others of her Friends to be diguised like Nuns: The Capuchins were she herself, her Husband, <hi>Jarry,</hi> and the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150088:57"/> Abbot <hi>de Villerse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

The King and Queen his Mother having been informed of this Masquerade, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly displeased with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and said openly that they would revenge the Injury and Contempt that had been had of Religion in that Occasion. Some time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Majesties were pacified, and all these Threatnings ended in their having no more esteem for Madam <hi>d' Olonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During all these passages, <hi>Jeannin</hi> pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably enjoyed his Mistress. When she caused the Lottery to be drawn, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready said that of Ten thousand Crowns she had received, she had employed but the half at most, and the greatest part of this half was distributed to the Capuchins, to the Nuns, and others of the Cabal. The Prince of <hi>Marsillac,</hi> who was young, to act the chiefest part upon this Stage, had the greatest Lot, which was a Silver Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern. <hi>Jeannin,</hi> with all the Favours he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, had only a Jewel of very small va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue: The great Rumour that run of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of this Lottery, vexed him to see that he was no better treated than the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.

               </gap> to Madam <hi>d' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne,</hi> she not thinking fit to acquaint him with her Roguery, received his Complaints very ill, insomuch that before they parted, they both fell to Reproaches, the one for his Money, the other for her Favours. The Conclusion of which was, Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s forbidding him her House, and <hi>Jeannin</hi> told her that he had never obeyed her so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly as he should do in that Occasion, and that this Command would save him both Trouble and Expence.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Beuvron</hi>'s Commerce with her, lasted still; whether the Spark was not much in love, or that he thought himself happy in having her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avours at any rate, he tormented her a little about her Behaviour, she also treated as one she made use of when others failed her, and her love for him was as little as nothing.</p>
            <p>Shortly after her falling out with <hi>Jeannin, Marsillac</hi> who had Friends who were much brisker than he was himself, was advised by them to apply himself to Madam <hi>d' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne,</hi> and told him that he was of an Age to make himself talked of, that Women procured Esteem as well as War, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> being one of the greatest Beauties of the Court, besides the great
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150088:58"/> Pleasures, would likewise be an Honour to him she should love; and that it was very glorious to fill the place of the Duke of <hi>Candale.</hi> With all these Reasons they eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on <hi>Marillac</hi> to make his Visits to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Olonne;</hi> but because he was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very distrustful of himself, his Cabal being also very distrustful of him, judged it was not fit he should be left upon his word with her; and it was concluded that <hi>Sillery</hi> should be appointed for his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and to assist him upon occasion. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillac</hi> had made great Application to her for two Months for this, without having spoke to her of Love, otherwise then in general terms: He had however told <hi>Sille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that it was above six Weeks since he had made an Amarous Declaration to her, and had likewise invented a very harsh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that he said she made him, that he might not think it strange he was so long without receiving Favours. Whereupon this Governour, to serve his Pupil, spoke thus to Madam <hi>d' Olonne: I know very well, Madam, that nothing is so free as Love, and that if the heart is not touched by inclination, the mind will never be much perswaded by words; but I must however tell you, that when a Person is young and unmarried, I do not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150088:59"/> comprehend why a young amorous Gentleman is refused, who is as well provided, or I am much mistaken, as any man about Court; it is poor</hi> Marsillac <hi>I speak of, Madam, since he is desperately in love with you, why are you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful? Or if you find you cannot love him, why do you amuse him? Love him or dismiss him. I know not since when,</hi> answered Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Olonne, that Men pretend we should love them, without their having made it their Request; for I have heard say, it was they who formerly made Court. I know very well that in these latter days they treat Gallantry after a strange manner; but I knew not that they had reduced it to the point of requiring that Wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n should be their Votaries. How,</hi> answered <hi>Sillery, has not</hi> Marsillac <hi>declared he loved you? No, Sir,</hi> said she to him, <hi>it is you who first tell it me. Not but that his Assid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have made me suspect he had some design; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t till we are spoke to, we do not understand the rest. Ah Madam,</hi> replied <hi>Sillery, you are not then so much in fault as I thought,</hi> Maril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac'<hi>s Youth renders him fearful; but the same Youth makes Women excuse several things: Persons of his Age are seldome faulty, and men but Twenty years old always meet with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion. I grant,</hi> replied Madam <hi>d' Olonne, that the Bashfulness of a young Man raises
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150088:59"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity, and never Anger; but I likewise pretend he should be respectful. Do you call respect, Madam,</hi> said <hi>Sillery</hi> to her, <hi>the not daring to say we are in love? It is all meer folly, I say, in regard of a Woman who would not make Returns: For in that Case the Gallant would not lose his time; and would quickly know what he was to trust to: But this respect which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Madam, is only of advantage to you with those you have no inclination for; for if the Man you are inclined to love should have too much of it, you would be very much perplexed.</hi> As he had done speaking, Company came in, whereupon he took his leave, and went to seek out <hi>Marsillac,</hi> to whom having made a thousand Reproaches for his Timidity, he made him promise that before that day was at an end, he would make an amorous Declaration to his Mistress: He likewise told him part of the things it was requisite he should say, which <hi>Marsillac</hi> had forgot within a Moment after; and having encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged him as much as he could, he saw him set out for this great Expedition.</p>
            <p>However <hi>Marsillac</hi> was under strange disquiets, sometimes he thought his Coach went too fast, sometimes he wished he might not find Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> at home, or that he might find some body with her:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150088:60"/> In a word, he feared the same things that a brisk Man would have desired with all his heart. However, he was so unhappy as to meet with his Mistress, and to find her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. He came up to her with so disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Countenance, that if <hi>Sillery</hi> had not already acquainted her with his Love, she would have discovered it by seeing him only that time. This Disorder helped to perswade her more then all he, or the Eloquence of his Friend could have said to her: And it is for this reason that Fools are more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than the Wise in Love.</p>
            <p>The first thing that <hi>Marsillac</hi> did after being seated, was putting on his Hat, so little was he himself; an instant after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his folly, he took off his Hat and Gloves, then put on one again, and all this without saying a Word. <hi>What's the matter, Sir,</hi> said Madam <hi>d' Olonne, you see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to be concerned at something. Do not you Divine it, Madam,</hi> said <hi>Marsillac? No,</hi> said she, <hi>I do not comprehend it; How should I understand what you do not tell me, being hardly able to conceive what I am told? I shall tell you then, what it is,</hi> replied <hi>Marsil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac</hi> simpering, <hi>I am in love with you. But why so much Ceremony,</hi> said she, <hi>for so small a thing: I do not see there is so much difficulty in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150088:60"/> loving, there appearing much more in loving well. Ah Madam! I find it much harder to tell it than to do it; I find none at all in loving you, and I should find it so difficult to cease loving you, that I should never be able to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, tho you should order it me a thousand times. I Sir,</hi> replied Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> blushing, <hi>I have nothing to C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mmand you.</hi> Any other than <hi>Marsillac</hi> would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the cunning way that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> made use of to permit him to love her: But his Wit was gone a Wool-gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all Delicacy upon him was lost-<hi>How Madam,</hi> said he to her, <hi>do you not esteem me enough to honour me with your Commands. Well,</hi> said she to him, <hi>should you be glad I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered you not to love me any longer? No, Madam,</hi> replied he bluntly. <hi>What would you be at then,</hi> said Madam <hi>d' Olonne? Love you as long as I live,</hi> said he. <hi>Well,</hi> said she, <hi>love me as long as you please and hope.</hi> This had been sufficient for a more pressing Gallant than <hi>Marsillac</hi> to have pretended to enjoyment immediately; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> could do, he made her wait two Months, and at length, when they came to the point, she was forced to make all the Advances. The establishing this new Commerce did not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150088:61"/> make her break that she had with <hi>Beuvron:</hi> The last Lover was ever the most beloved, but he was not so much in her Favour as to drive away <hi>Beuvron,</hi> who was a second Husband to her.</p>
            <p>A little before the Rupture of <hi>Jeannin</hi> with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> the Chevalier of <hi>Grammont</hi> was fallen in love with her, and he being a very extraordinary Person, it is fit I give a Description of him.</p>
            <p>The Chevalier had brisk Eyes, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Nose, a pretty Mouth, a dimple in his Chin, and I know not what of fine in his Phisiognomy, his Shape had been comely, had he not stooped, his Wit was delicate and gallant. However, his Meen and his Accent gave a Grace to what he said, that became nothing in the Mouth of another. A mark of this is that he writ the worst of any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and he writ as he spoke. Though it be superfluous to say that a Rival is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode, the Chevalier was to that point, that it would have been better for a poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be troubled with four others then he alone. He was so sprightly that he hardly ever slept, he was liberal to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and by that means his Mistress and his Rivals could not have Servants nor Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets but what he knew, otherwise the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150088:61"/> best Man in the World. It was twelve years since he began to love the Countess of <hi>Fiesque,</hi> a Woman as extraordinary as he was a Man, that is to say, as singular in Merits as he was in ill Qualities; but as of those twelve years she had been banished, five from Mademoiselle <hi>d' Orleans, Gaston</hi>'s of <hi>France</hi>'s Daughter, a Princess whom Fortune persecuted, because she had Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and could not reduce her great Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to the basenesses that the Court de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. During their absence the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier had tied himself to a very regular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy; and tho the Countess was very lovely, he merited some excuse for his Lightness, being he had never received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny favour from her. He had however cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed several to be jealous; <hi>Rouville</hi> was one of those who were so: As he was one day reproaching the Countess that she loved the Chevalier, that fair One told him that he was mad to believe she could love the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Cheat in the World. <hi>This is a pleasant reason, Madam, which you alledge, I know you are a greater Cheat than he, and yet I cannot forbear loving you▪</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho the Chevalier was in love with all Women, the Countess however had that power over him, that what engagement
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150088:62"/> soever he had elsewhere, so soon as he knew that any One visited her oftner that ordinary, he quitted all to return to her▪ And he was in the Right, for the Countess was a lovely Woman, she had blew and sparkling Eyes, a handsome Nose, an agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mouth, of a fine Colour, and white and smooth Skin; the forme of her Face was long, and never any One but she in the world was embelished with a long Chin; her hair was brown, and she was ever Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly drest, but her finery proceeded rather from Art than the magnificence of her Clothes; her Will was free and naturall▪ her Humour cannot be described, for it was with the Modesty of her Sex of the Humour of all the World. People by much think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what they have to do, think usually better at the end than at the beginning. The contrary happened usually to the Countess, her Reflections spoyled her first Motions. I know not if the Confidence she had in her Merit made her careless of seeking Lovers, for she took no pains at all to have them. And indeed when▪ any One of himself made his addresses to her, she neither affected Rigour to be rid of him, nor Kindness to retain him, he left of his Courtship if he pleased, if he pleased he
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150088:62"/> continued it: and what course soever he took he did not subsist to her cost. So that the Chevalier as I have said, had not visited her in five years time, and during that absence that he might not lose time he had had a thousand Mistresses, amongst others <hi>Victoria Manciri,</hi> Duchess of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeur,</hi> and three dayes after her Death, Madam <hi>de Villars,</hi> and it was for this reason that <hi>Benserade,</hi> who was in love with her, made this Sonnet upon the Chevalier.</p>

            <p>The Countess returning some time after to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Chevalier not being tyed to Madam <hi>Villars</hi> by any favours, quitted her to return to the Countess; but as he was never long in the same state, and being tyred with her, he made his addresses to Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> at the same time that <hi>Marsillac</hi> entred into an engagement with her, and tho the Chevalier was less Modest than <hi>Marsillac</hi> with the Ladies, he was not however the more pressing; on the contrary provided he might toy with 'em, have it said in the world that he was in love, find some People of easie belief to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his vanity, put a Rival in pain, be better received than he, he was not at all fond of a surrender. One thing he did that made it more difficult for him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade than it was for another, was that he never spoke seriously. Insomuch that a Woman must needs flatter her self ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely, to beleive he was in love with her.</p>
            <p>I have already said that never any Gallant that was not beloved was more incommode than he, he had ever two or three Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies without Liveries, whom he called his Bloodhounds, whom he caused to dog and observe his Rivals and his Mistresses.

            <p>An honest welbred Man having convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his Mistress of loving another than himself, withdraws immediately and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out noise, particularly if she had not made him any promise; but the Chevalier was not of that humour; when he could not procure being beloved, he would rather chose to have been stabbed than leave his Mistress and Rival in repose.

Then this Lover fancying that a Letter would do his buisness much better than all he had done or said thitherto, in that Opinion he writ to her in these termes.</p>

            <p>Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> having received this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, carried it immediately to the Countess, with whom she fancyed it had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:150088:64"/> but did not seem to beleive any such thing at first. As there was alwayes a seeming kindness between them, she smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling valued at a high rate her refusing her Lover, and the notice she gave of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity he would have committed. This vexed the Countess, tho she did not love the Chevalier: most Women are no more willing to lose their Lovers whom they had no kindness for than those they favour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and particularly when they abandon them to give themselves to others, and their Vexation does not so much proceed from the loss they have as from the preference of their Rivals: which was the Countesses case in this encounter. However she thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> for the intention she had to oblige her, but protested she had no engagement with the Chevalier, but that on the contrary she should be obliged to those who would rid her of him. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> did not content her self with shewing that Letter to the Countess, she likewise vapoured with it to <hi>Marsillac;</hi> and whether she or the Countess spoke of it to others, every body knew that the Poor Chevalier had been sacrificed, and he himself was quickly acquainted with the jeasts that were made upon his Letter▪
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:150088:65"/> Contempt offends all Lovers, but when Raillery is joyned with it they are netled to the heart: The Chevalier seeing himself Casheired and laughed at, kept no longer any measures, he said all manner of ill things of Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in this Occasion, that this foolish Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had found the secret of losing her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation by preserving her Honour of being Cruel, and cryed out upon for a Gilt.</p>
            <p>The Chevalier hated none of his Rivals so much as he did <hi>Marsillac,</hi> as well because he thought him better treated, as for that he fancyed he the least deserved it: he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s Lovers, the Philistins, and said that <hi>Marsillac</hi> by reason he had but little Wit, had defeated them all with the Jaw bone Bone of an Ass.</p>
            <p>In this same time the Count of <hi>Guiche,</hi> the Mareschal of <hi>Grammont</hi>'s Son, as beautiful as an Angell, and full of Love, fancyed that the conquest of the Countess would be both easie and honorable to him; insomuch that he resolved to undertake it out of motives of Glory; he mentioned it to <hi>Manicamp</hi> his faithful and necessary Friend, who approved his designe, and offered to serve him in it. The Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> and <hi>Manicamp</hi> have so great a part
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:150088:65"/> in this story, that it is necessary to speak of them <hi>en passant,</hi> and make them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly known; and in order to that it is fit I begin with the description of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>The count <hi>de Guiche</hi> had great black Eyes, a handsome Nose, well made, his Mouth was something wide, the forme of his Face round, his Complexion was admirable, had a great Forehead and a fine Shape: he had Wit, was very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, addicted to raillery, light, presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous, brave, hasty and without friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: he was Colonel of the French Gards, jointly with the Mareschal of <hi>Grammont</hi> his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Manicamp</hi> had sweet blew Eyes, a Hawk's Nose, a wide Mouth, his Lips were very red and full, his Complexion was something yellow, his Face was flat, his Haire thick long and white, his Shape was fine if it had not been too much neglected: As for Wit she had enough of the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s sort; he had not acquired so much, but his <hi>Genius</hi> way at least as good; his Fortune not being so well setled as the others, made him something the more cautious; but they had naturally both the same incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to the hinder parts and to raillery;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:150088:66"/> and indeed they loved one another as a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently as if they had been of different Sexes.</p>
            <p>At the same time Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the World the Chevalier <hi>de Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>'s Letter, he discovered the love the Count <hi>de Guicke</hi> had for the Countess of <hi>Fiesque,</hi> this was of no small use to him for the making her fall out with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> fancying his Reconciliation would be the more easy with the Countess, the less he kept measures with the others: but while he is endeavouring to make Peace for himself, let us se what the Count <hi>de Guicke</hi> did to render himself lovely. First you must know then that the Count had a very great passion for Mademoiselle <hi>de Beauvais,</hi> a Maid of mean Birth, but of a great deal of Wit; it must likewise be known that he had been so traversed by his Relations in that Amour, that they feared she would make him commit the same folly, that his Sister had caused the Marquess of <hi>Richilieu</hi> to do, whom that Consideration, as well as the Rigours of the faire One, had very much disgusted, and had the deeper engaged him in the design of Loving the Countess; but he had not for this fair One, all the inclination she deserved, and it was less a second passion than a Remedy to the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:150088:66"/> former. But he got little ground, &amp; all that he could do was to move the Countess and to put the Chevalier into dispair, and for that end he kept to Lookes and Assiduities, without caring to spur on faster. The Countess, whose heart, as is beleived, was never smitten with any thing but the merit of <hi>Guistand,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, whom she had not seen in four or five years, but with whom she had kept a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of Letters, felt her Constancy sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Count <hi>de Guiches</hi> addresses, and notwithstanding all that <hi>Gersé, Guistavel</hi>'s friend, could say to her, for the obliging her to chace away the Count, she would not at first yeild to it, but seemed to ridicule that Amour, and a long time elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Counsels of all her friends: yet at length she her self perceiving that the Count took no advantage of it, she resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to procure her self honour by making a Virtue of the necessity she beleived her self in of loving her, and that this might not seem a Sacrifice to the Chevalier, who had bragged he could cause his Nephew to be Cashiered, she turned them both off, yeilding at that time to the advise of <hi>Gersé,</hi> as she told him; and hereupon was made this jeast, that the Countess was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:150088:67"/> going to signe the Discharges and Passports of her Lovers, but the Chevalier caused her to be so intreated by her best Friends, that he obtained leave to see her at a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights end, and it was upon this that this Song was made to the tune of Saraband.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>So zealously old <hi>Gersé</hi> plaid his part,</l>
               <l>With such success he serv'd his Flemmish Friend,</l>
               <l>That the fair Lady, who has still my Heart,</l>
               <l>Never to see her did me Orders send.</l>
               <l>He fancied then, and I was much afraid,</l>
               <l>An everlasting Doom on me was laid;</l>
               <l>In a short banishment yet all will end.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Five or six Months being passed, during which the Chevalier was too happy, he was not troubled with his Nephew, had enjoyed the pleasures of solely loving the Countess; some freinds of the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to him that being the handsomest Man of the Court, it was a shame for him to find any Lady cruel, and that the success he had had with the Countess had done him any injury in the world: these reasons made him resolve to reingage himself: He returned from he Campagne wounded in his Right Hand, but his Wound, tho great, not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:150088:67"/> having hindred him from going abroad sometimes, he met the Countess One day in the <hi>Tuilleryes:</hi> He had the Abbot <hi>Fouequett</hi> with him, who was that Lady's particular friend, who thinking to do them a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, engaged them in discourse, and left them together a pretty long time. The Count said nothing at all of love, but his ways and his looks made the Countess understand but too much, nay more than he designed she should: This Conversation was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ended by the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s fainting away, out of which he was recovered by the help of the Countess and the Abbot.</p>
            <p>Their Opinion of the cause of his saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away were divers, the Abbot attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to the Counts wound, and the Countess to his passion. A Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves nothing more willingly than that she is beloved, because Love makes her beleive that she ought to be beloved, and because One is not hard to be perswaded of what One desires. These reasons made the Countess not at all doubt of the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Love. At that time Madam <hi>de Olonne</hi> not being willing that a young spark so well made should escape her, desired <hi>Vieneuil</hi> to bring the Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:150088:68"/> come, he went from thence as free as he came thither. He continued his Design for the Countess, his Assiduities having renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Chevaliers jealousie; he to inform himself how his Nephew stood with his Mistress, wrote with his left Hand the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Letter to that fair One.</p>

            <p>The Countess having read this Letter, gave charge to her Porter to bid him who should come for an Answer, that he should tell his Master, That he should send <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp</hi> to her at Three a Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. When the Chevalier had received this Answer, he fancied he had wherewith to Convict the Countess of being in the deepest Engagement of an Amorous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue with his Nephew; and in that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he went to her House: The Rage he was in had so changed his Countenance, that had the Countess ever so little distru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted

The truth is,</hi> said the Countess, <hi>that</hi> Manicamp <hi>has newly sent to ask me if the Count</hi> de Guiche <hi>might come and see me to day; and I sent him word, he should come without his Friend.

               <hi>Manicamp</hi> went and sought every where for the Countess, and having at length found her at Play at Madam <hi>de Bonnell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Countess withdrawing some time after to her own House, having left off Play, in taking out her Handkerchief, she found the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Letter, sealed and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Superscription; if she had thought what it was, she would not have opened it, but for fear she should be obliged not to break it open, she was not willing to spend thoughts upon it, and opened it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:150088:70"/> without the least reflexion: All the Countesse's vivacity could not make her i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine what the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> meant by his being dissatisfied with <hi>Manicamp;</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that she ordered one of her Servants to go tell him, he should come and see her on the Morrow, being resolved to rattle him for the Letter he had given her from the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> and to forbid him to charge himself with any more for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As he entred the Chamber the next day, her Curiosity made her forget her Anger: <hi>Well,</hi> said she, <hi>tell me your quarrel with your Friend. It is, Madam,</hi> said he to her, <hi>that as I was bringing you a Letter two days ago, I lost it, and he is enraged against me, and I know not what to say to him, for I am in the fault.</hi> The Countess fearing this lost Letter might be found by some one who might make a Story of it, to make the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Sport; <hi>Go,</hi> said she to him, <hi>go seek it every where, and do not return till you have brought it me back. Manicamp</hi> went away immediately, and returned in the Evening to tell her, that he could not find it, that the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> would no longer see him, and that he came to beseech her to reconcile them. <hi>I will,</hi> said she, <hi>tho you do not deserve it: And I shall go to morrow to

Tho we are fallen out, Madam,</hi> answered <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp, I cannot forbear telling you still that he deserves that favour. Do not think of him in this Occasion, give this Letter to the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship you have for me, and I promise that when it has done the business, I will return it into your hands.</hi> The Countess having made him engage his word he would bring back her Letter, she writ to him the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in these terms.</p>

            <p>That advice was to be very distrustful of the Chevalier, who did all he could to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse his Nephew, and to make him appear indiscreet and unfaithful to the Countess. After that <hi>Manicamp</hi> told her that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she had written to the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> had so transported him with joy, that it was impossible to get it from him, but that she should not be in pain, for that it would be as safe in his Friends hands as in the fire;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:150088:72"/> and moreover, that he had never seen a Man so much in love as the Count was, and that he would certainly love her as long as he lived. <hi>But,</hi> interrupted the Countess, <hi>what is the meaning of so many Visits that your Friend makes to Madam</hi> d' Olonne? <hi>Does he go to desire her to intercede with me for him? He does not visit her at all, Madam,</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Manicamp, that is to say, he has been there but once or twice; but I discover the Chivali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Malice in what you tell me, and I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Count</hi> de Guiche <hi>will know this Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish trick to be of his Ʋnkles stamp. But, Madam, hear my Friend before you Condemn him. I am of your Opinion,</hi> said she to him; and indeed <hi>Manicamp</hi> guessed right: For the Chevalier had told the Countess that the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> was in love with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> that she only served for a Pretext, and a thousand other things of that Nature, that appeared to her so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that though she distrusted the Chevali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in what concerned the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> she could not forbear giving Credit to him in this Encounter. The next day a Lady of her Acquaintance being come to press her to go into the Country, she let herself be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded: And really fancying the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> false, she would not come to any
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:150088:72"/> Explication with him; and not to break off all, she thought it convenient to prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess <hi>Guitand</hi> by a false Confidence, for fear he should learn by other means the truth of all; Wherefore she sent him a Copy of the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s last Letter, and after that her Friend and she went out of Town. The Chevalier, who had an Eye upon all the Countesses Actions, and had bribed all her Servants, had the Pacquet she sent to <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tand</hi> two hours after it was made up. He took a Copy of the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and cast the Pacquet into the Fire. Two days after, having learnt that the Countess was gone, he wrote to her this Letter.</p>

            <p>While this Letter was a carrying to the Countess, the Chevalier went to seek out his Nephew, with whom he found <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp.</hi> After a Prologue of Raillery upon the good Fortunes of the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> in General: <hi>Faith, my poor Friends,</hi> said he to them, <hi>I confess you are younger and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeler than I am, and I shall never dispute with you a Mistress I have not been a long time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: But however, you must yield the Countess to me, and all those I have any Engagement with. The Vanity Women take in a great number of Galants may oblige them to give you some hopes. There are few who at the first onset will stifle the Vows of their Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: But sooner or later they return to reason; and it is then that the new Comer passes his time very ill, and that the old Gallant jointly with his Mistress cry, Farewel you Gentlemen Serenaders. You promised me, Count</hi> de Guiche, <hi>never to torment me more, as to what concerns the Countess; you have broke your word, and committed an infidelity that has done you no good: For the Countess has given me all the Letters you wrote to her; I'le show you the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals when you will: In the mean time here is a Copy of the last Letter you sent her;</hi> and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, he took out a Letter of the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s, and having read it; <hi>Well! my
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150088:73"/> Dears,</hi> said he to them, <hi>you'l hunt upon my grounds again, will you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the Chevalier was speaking, the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> and <hi>Manicamp</hi> looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazedly upon one another, not being able to comprehend that the Countess had so basely deceived them. At length <hi>Manicamp</hi> broak silence, and addressing himself to the Count, <hi>You are treated,</hi> said he to him, <hi>as you deserved; but since the Countess has not had any Consideration for us,</hi> added he, turning towards the Chevalier, <hi>we are not obliged to have any for her: We easily perceived we have been Sacrificed, but there was a time, Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, that you was so too; We have indeed great reason to complain of her, but you have none at all to be satisfied with her: When we some times rejoyced and were merry at your Costs, the Countess went halves with us at the least. The truth is,</hi> said the Count <hi>de Guiche, that you would not have reason to be satisfied with the Countesses preference in your Favours, if you knew the esteem she has of you; and this makes me draw infallible Consequences that she is deeply engaged with you, since after all the things she has told me, she only betrays me to give you satisfaction.</hi> Thereupon being all three really reconciled, and having given one another a thousand Assurances of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150088:74"/> Friendship for the future, they parted.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> and <hi>Manicamp</hi> shut themselves up to make a Letter of reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in <hi>Manicamps</hi> Name to the Countess, to which the poor Countess being innocent, made answer, that he and his Friend had been taken for Cullies, and that the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier was cunninger than they; that she could not tell by what means he had got the Letter he had showed them, but that they One day should clearly see that she had not made a Sacrifice of them. This Letter not finding <hi>Manicamp</hi> any longer at <hi>Paris,</hi> he being gone out the day before with the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> to follow the King in his Progress to <hi>Lyons,</hi> he did not receive it till he arrived at Court, and thought neither the more, nor the less advantageously of the Countess: during all these passages, <hi>Marsillac</hi>'s Intrigue with Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> jogged on▪ that Lover seeing her with the greatest conveniency imaginable by night at her House, and by day at Mademoiselle <hi>de Cornuelle</hi>'s, a lovely Creature, and of a great deal of Wit. Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> had by her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side a Closet, in a corner of which she had caused a trap Door to be made, which went into another Closet underneath, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

               <hi>Marsillac</hi> entred when it was night; a Foot-Carpet concealed the Trapdoor, and a Table covered it. Thus <hi>Marsillac</hi> passing the Night with Madam <hi>d'Olonne,</hi> according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon report, did not lose his time: This lasted till she went to the Waters, in which time <hi>Marsillac,</hi> who wrote to her a thousand Letters that are not mentioned here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not worth the pains; wrote this Amourous Ticket to her one day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forebidding her Adieu.</p>

               <hi>Marsillac</hi> did not fail to be at the Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation much sooner than ordinary; In accosting his Mistress he flung himself upon her Bed, and was thus a long time melting into tears, and all his words were interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by sobs. Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> for her part appeared no less concerned, but as she was desirous to receive other Marks of Love from her Galant than those of Grief, <hi>How! my Dear,</hi> said she to him, <hi>you sent me word a little while a go that my Grief would ease yours, and yet the affliction you see me in, does not render you the more capable of Comfort.</hi> At these words <hi>Marsillac</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled his sighs, without making her an answer, the dulness of his Soul had caused the same effect in his Body; and I fancy that this Lover deplored at that time more the absence of his Vigour, than that of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress. However as young People recover easily, and he being of a good complexion,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:150088:75"/> he began to come to himself, and recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his strength in a little time: Insomuch that Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> could hardly discover he had been so lately ill. After he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her so many testimonies of his good health, she recommended to him to have care of it above all things, and told him that he should judge thereby of the Love he had for her. Thereupon they made a thousand Protestations of loving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all their life-time; they agreed of the means of writing, and then took leave, the one to go to Court, the other to the wells. Prince <hi>Marsillac</hi> went the next day to take his leave of Mademoiselle <hi>Cornu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elle,</hi> his good Friend, he desired her to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade his Mistress to be more circumspect in her Carriage than she had yet been. <hi>Rely upon me for that,</hi> said this young Lady to him, <hi>she must be very incorrigible if I do not keep her within bounds.</hi> Two dayes after Mademoiselle <hi>Cornuelle</hi> went to Madam <hi>d' Olonnes,</hi> and having prayed her to order her Porter to say she was gone out: <hi>I am too much your friend, Madam,</hi> said she to her, not <hi>to speake franckly to you in all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns your Carriage and your Reputation; you are beautyfull, young, you are of Quality, you have Riches and will, you have infinitely
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150088:76"/> Charmed a Prince who loves you extreamly: All this ought to render you however you are not so; you know what Reports run of you, we have talked of them sometimes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this being so, you are mad you are not contented: I do not pretend to consider your weakenesses, I am a Woman as well as you, and I know by my self the want of our Sex: Your Manners are insupportable, you love pleasures Madam, and I allow them, but you take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to set People a talking, and it is that I condemn you for; Can you not leave off your Extravagances? it is impossible but that you must be in a Rage, when you hear of the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation you have in the world, and Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the love they have for you more out of Shame than Modesty. Well my Dear,</hi> said Madam <hi>d'Olonne, do you here any thing new? does the World renew its Satyr's against me? No, Madam,</hi> said Mademoiselle, <hi>it does on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continue them, because you still continue to give it new matters. I know not what I must do then,</hi> replyed Madam <hi>d' Olonne, all the Prudence that one can have in love, I fancyed I had; and that since I have been concerned in loving, I never fruitlesly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed nor spun out any Intrigue, well knowing that the greatest Noise is usually made before the business is agreed on; and when Lovers act
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:150088:76"/> not in Concert together. Prethee tell me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly my Dear, added she, what I must do to love well, and entertain a Gallantry, that shall do me no injury in the world, tho it should be suspected: For I am resolved to do my Devoir in the future with the utmost Regularity There are so many things to say upon that point,</hi> said Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiselle <hi>Cornu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lle, that I should never have don, if I would neglect nothing, however I shall tell you the principal as succinctly as possible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First you must know Madam, that there are three sorts of Women who make love, The Debauchées, the Cocquets, and the honest Mistresses. Tho the first are abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, they certainly deserve more compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than hatred, because they are hurryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the force of their Temper, and that almost an impossible application is required to reforme Nature; however if in any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter we ought to conquer our selves, it is in that, wherein no less is concerned than our honours or lives.</p>
            <p>As for Cocquets, the number being much greater, I shall enlarge more upon that point: The difference between De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchées, and them, is, that in the Ill the former commit, there is at least sincerity, and in what the Cocquets do there is Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery: The Cocquets tell us to excuse
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:150088:77"/> themselves when they give ear to the Courtship of all Comers, that how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest soever a Woman is, she never hates a person who tells her he loves her.</p>
            <p>But one may answer them that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are to be made: either that Lover addresses himself to a Woman, who will be either honest for her self or for a Lover: allow that she cannot hate a Man for the Sentiments he had for her, yet this will not hinder her from being carefull of not having so much Complaisance for him as for another, who had never declared any thing to her, for fear she should thereby entertain his hopes, and that at length it might make a noise, and be injurious to the reputation she would preserve.</p>
            <p>If the Woman be prepossessed that the Man declares love to her, she will have the same precautions as the other to hinder it from continuing, but if he persists, I maintain that she shall hate him as much as she shall love her true Gallant: it being natural to hate the Enemies of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we love, because love will not allow love to be importunate, and because that a Lover well treated may suspect that a Passion that continues in his Rival, is at least nourished by some hopes; an honest
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150088:77"/> Mistress considers his Rival as her mortal Enemy, who maks her run the risque of losing her Lover whom she loves more than her life. This being plain, you must likewise know that there are several sorts of Cocquets; some take a pride in being beloved by a great many People, without ever loving any of them, and do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it is the advances themselves make which invite men, and which retain them rather than merit. Besides as it is not possible they should dispose their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours so equally, but that some one will seem better treated than others, and there being some who will not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with equality, but pretend to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; This gives jealousy to the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, and makes them say in quitting them, all, nay more than they know.</p>
            <p>There are other Cocquets who manage se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Lovers, that they may save the real one in the multitude, and cause it to be said, they have no amorous Intrigue, since they treat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually all those who visit them; but the best luck that can happen to them is to have the truth discovered; or at least, it is better than by believing they love no Body, every one fancies they love All.</p>
            <p>There are others who by managing se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:150088:78"/> Gallants would fain perswade, that if they should love any one of them, they should hazard the vexing him, In the mean time they vex and lose him by these means. For to imagine that it is in the absence of their true Lover that they make love, he will know nothing of it; or if it is in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, by acting in concert together, he will easily see that is nothing, since he is taken for a Witness of what is done, or at all hazards if he is troubled, their Cares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him, and their Promises to do so no more, will oblige him to be satisfied. All this is very subject to caution, a Lover is not long deceived, and if he does not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it to day, he will discover it to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>And crying 'tis well, adieu my Dear,</l>
               <l>I find no longer pleasure here.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And tho his Passion should be so strong, that he could not get rid▪ of it, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and noise he would make, would occasion more vexation to the Cocquet Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress than all those managements could have procured her Pleasure. There are Cocquets who fancy they have so ill a repute in the World, that they dare not be cruel and rigorous to any man, for fear it should pass for a Sacrifice to some other, and ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:150088:78"/> think that it would be better for their Honour that they were convicted of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: This is, Madam, the Course the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets take. I must let you see that of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Mistresses.</p>
            <p>As for them, they are either satisfied with their Lovers, or they are not: If they are not, they endeavour to reduce them to their Devoir by a tender and civil Carriage: If this cannot absolutely be, they break off without noise, upon a pretext of Devotion, or the Jealousie of a Husband, after having got from them, if they can, their Letters, and all that could Convict them: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things they so contrive it, that their Lovers do not fancy they abandom them for others.</p>
            <p>If they are satisfied with their Lovers, they love them with all their hearts, they are continually telling it them, and they write them the kindest Letters they can: But as this does not prove their love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Coquets say as much, or more every day, their Actions and their Carriage does sufficiently justifie the meaning of their Hearts, because there is only that infallible. We can indeed say, We love tho we do not, but we cannot seem kind to any one long without having an affection for him.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:150088:79"/>
            <p>An honest Mistress is more afraid of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jealousie to her Gallant than of Death, and when she sees him alarmed with any Suspicion that the obstinacy of his Rival might give him, she does not content her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the testimony of her Conscience, she redoubles her Cares and Caresses for him, and her rigours for the other; she does not defer the extreamest Severity till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, fancying she could never be soon enough rid of an importunate Person. She knows that as many Moments as she defers the chacing away this Rival, she should give as many stabs in his Heart she is in love with. She knows that as soon as her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver begins to have Suspicions, the least care she should take to remove them, would preserve in him the esteem and love he has for her; whereas if she neglected to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and cure him, he would come again to have so little Confidence in her, that she should not be able to recover his good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, tho she even offered him to lose her Reputation for his sake. She knows that a Lover would ever believe, that it would be the fear she was in of him, had forced those Sacrifices from her, that at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time he would have took for great Marks of love. She knows that in the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:150088:79"/> a Man confides in, all is excused, and that nothing is pardoned in her that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusted. She knows that at length a Man comes to be fatigued with the trouble a Mistress gives him, and the reproaches that he has made her after having pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her a thousand considerable Faults, that he breaks off upon a Trifle, the measures being plain, and he not able to suffer any longer so much vexation.</p>
            <p>There are Women who love their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants extreamly, and yet make them jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous by their ill carriage, and this proceeds from their flattering themselves too much with the assurance they have of their good Intentions, and for that they do not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently quash the hopes of those men, who make Court to them, or who only seem to love them by their Cares and their Assidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and they are ignorant that the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of a Woman one loves, are such Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours as all Lovers flatter themselves with sometimes, because they have Merit; or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten because they think they have so: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times because they have no good Opinion of the Persons they make their Addresses to, and who fancy that the resistance that they make is only to set a greater value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves. Insomuch, that if a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:150088:80"/> who has never given occasion to be talked of, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he ought to take care, as I have already said, not to entertain in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the hopes of all that has the Air of a Lover, and if it is a Woman who has not thitherto b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

               </gap> careful enough of her Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but designs to be so for the future, which is your case, Madam, it is requisite that she be more rude than another, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially that she be impartial in her Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for the least favour she shall let herself loose to, does more reingage a Lover than a thousand Refusals does disgust him.</p>
            <p>An honest Mistress has so much sincerity for her Lover, that rather than fail to tell him things of consequence, she tells him even what are trifles: Well knowing, that if he came to be informed by other means of certain indifferent things, that are rendred Criminal at their being told again, it would have the worst effect imaginable. She keeps no Measures with him in point of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, she tells him not only her own se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, but even those she knew before, or what she learns elsewhere every day. She calls those people ridiculous, Who say, that being Mistress of anothers Secrets, we ought not to tell it our Lovers: She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:150088:80"/> to that, that if they still love us, they will never say any thing of it: And if they happen to abandon us, we should have much more to lose than our Friends secret; but she fancies, we ought never to consider them, as such as will one day leave off loving us, and that otherwise we should be Fools to grant them Favours.</p>
            <p>In a word, her Maxim is, That who gives her heart has nothing more to manage; she knows that there are only two Encounters that can dispence her from telling all to her Lover; the one if he was indiscreet, and the other if he had any Gallantry before hers. For it would be imprudence in her to speak to him in that case, at least with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he pressed her extreamly, and then it would be he himself that occasioned his own Vexation.</p>
            <p>Finally, an honest Mistress believes that what justifies her Love even with the most severe Men, is, when she is deeply smitten, when she takes pleasure in making it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to her Lover, when she surprizes him by a thousand little favours, that he did not expect; when she has no reserve for him; when she applies herself to procure him esteem amongst all People; and that in a word, she makes of her Passion the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:150088:81"/> business of her Life: Without this, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, she holds Love for a Debauche, and that it is a Brutal Commerce, and a Trade by which ruined Women subsist.</p>
            <p>Mademoiselle <hi>de Cornuelle</hi> having left off speaking, Good God! said Madam <hi>d' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne,</hi> what fine things have you now said; but how difficult are they to be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice? I even find therein some injustice; for in a word, since we even deceive our Husbands, whom the Laws have made our Masters, why should our Gallants come off at a better rate? They whom nothing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to love but the choice we make, and whom we take to serve us as long, and as little as we please. I did not say, answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mademoiselle <hi>de Cornuelle,</hi> that we ought not to abandon our Gallants, when they displease us either by their own defects, or our weariness; but I have shown you the nice manner by which you ought to disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage your self from them, not to give them any reason to cry out upon you in the world: For in a word, Madam, since they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that tyranny upon the Honour of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, not to love what they find lovely, we must comply with Custome, and conceal our selves at least when we will love. Well my Dear, said Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> to her, I
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:150088:81"/> am going to act wonders, I am fully resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of it, but withal I ground the greatest hopes of my Conduct upon avoiding Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
            <p>Whether it be by avoiding, or resistance, said Mademoiselle <hi>de Cornuelle,</hi> it is no matter, provided your Lover be satisfied with you; and thereupon having exhorted her to remain firm in her good Intentions, she took her leave.</p>
            <p>During Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s separation from <hi>Marsillac,</hi> they wrote to one another very often, but as there was nothing therein remarkable, I shall not mention their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which spoke of their love, and of their impatience to see one another again, but in a very common manner. Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> was the first who returned to <hi>Paris;</hi> the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> during the Progress to <hi>Lyons,</hi> perswaded <hi>Monsieur,</hi> the King's Brother, with whom he was much in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to have a Gallantry at his return to <hi>Paris</hi> with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himself to serve him in it, and to procure him content in a short time. This Prince had promised the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> to make the necessary Paces to engage that Cocquet, insomuch that in the Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:150088:82"/> spoke to her of the love that Prince had for her: He told her that he had declared it to him more than an hundred times up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Journey, and that she would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly see him sigh assoon as he was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A Woman who had Citizens and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen her Gallants, some handsome, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ugly, might well love a comely Prince, Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> received the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Proposition with an unexpressible joy; and it was so great, that she did not so much as make those Excuses which Coquets make in such like Encounters. Another would have said that she would not love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, but less a Prince than any man so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, because he would not have so much application. Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> who was the most natural Woman in the World, and the most passionate, kept no bounds of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, but answered the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> That she esteemed herself more than she had yet done, since she pleased so great and so rational a Prince. When the Court was returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> did not answer the eagernesses, the Count had prepared Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> for, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered herself all entirely. All this produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced nothing, and made her but the more know how indifferent she was to that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:150088:82"/> Prince. The Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> seeing that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> did not bite at the Hook, changed his Design, and was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous at least that the Services he would have rendred to Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> should be of some advantage to him. Whereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to act the part of a Lover himself, and being the Commerce he had had with her upon the Amours of the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> had made him very familiar, he did not balance to write to her this Letter.</p>

            <p>Let People say what they will against Women, there is sometimes more impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than malice in their Conduct: Most of them no longer think, when they are courted, that they ought never to love: In the mean time they proceed further than they imagine, they do things sometimes, thinking they shall be always Cruel, which they extreamly repent of, when they are become more Humane. The same thing happened to Madam <hi>d' Olonne;</hi> she was stung to the quick that she had failed of the Prince's Heart, after having reckoned it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst her Conquests; in seeking some one to apply herself to for the amusing her grief, she found nothing more likely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, than that the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> for his own Interest had hindred him from loving her. Insomuch that as well to revenge her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of him, as to reassure <hi>Marsillac,</hi> whom this Intrigue had alarmed, she sacrificed to him the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Letter, without considering that Love would perhaps ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:150088:83"/> her to do the same with those of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillac,</hi> and he whom Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> gave a thousand Favours to, made the use of them that is common, when one is satisfied with his Mistress, he rendred her a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand thanks for her Sincerity, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself with triumphing over his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, without showing any indiscreet Pride.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> not knowing the Destiny of his Letter, went the day after to Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s House; but so much Company was there that day, that he could not speak to her about busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at that time. He only observed that she had eyed him very much, and from her House he went to acquaint <hi>Fiesque</hi> with the state of his Affairs, who since his return from <hi>Lyons,</hi> he had made his Confident; he went likewise to tell the same to <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> and they both judged by the weakness of the Lady, and the Gentleness of the Spark, that his pursuit would neither be long nor in vain: And the truth is, Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> had found the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> so handsome, and so much to her mind, that she repented the Sacrifice she had newly made to <hi>Marsillac.</hi> The day after the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> returned to her House, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:150088:84"/> having found her alone, he spoke to her of his Passion, the fair One was pleased, and received that Declaration the most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greably imaginable; but after having agreed upon loving one another, as they were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certain Conditions, People came in; which obliged the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> to go out a Moment after.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> having disingaged her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from her Company as soon as she was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, took Coach, being desirous to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver if the Countess <hi>de Fiesque</hi> took no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest any longer in the Count <hi>de Guiche:</hi> She went to her, and after some Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon other subjects, she asked her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the Designes she told her the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> had for her. The Countess told her that she was only to consult her Heart in such Occasions: <hi>My heart does not say to me much in favour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f the Count,</hi> replyed Madam <hi>d' Olonne, and my Reason tells me a thousand things against him: He is a Spark I can never love.</hi> In saying these words, she took leave of the Countess, without wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her Answer.</p>
            <p>On the other side the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to his House, he met with <hi>Vinevil,</hi> who waited for him with great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to know what posture his Affairs
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:150088:84"/> were in; the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> told him something coldly, that he believed all was broaken off, considering how Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> treated him; and <hi>Vinevil</hi> desiring to know the particulars of the Conversation, the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> not being willing to discover what passed, changed discourse every moment; this gave some suspicions to <hi>Vineuil</hi> who was cunning and in love with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and only concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himself in the affairs of the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> that he might prevail with his Mistress by the things he should have learnt. He went away seeing he could not make any discovery, and was for three days in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal disquiets, not being able to learn the certainty of what he suspected, and what he would know. He went to <hi>Fiesque's</hi> House with the Countenance of a disgraced Favourite, since he saw he had no longer any share in the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he said nothing of it to that fair One, not to discredit himself in showing his Misfortune,</p>
            <p>At three days end he went to the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s House. <hi>What have I done my Lord,</hi> said he to him, <hi>that obliges you to treat me thus? I easily perceive that you hide from me your intrigue with Madam</hi> de Olonne,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:150088:85"/>
               <hi>learn me the reason of it, or if you have none, continue to tell me what you know as you used to do. I ask your pardon my poor</hi> Vinevil, said the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> to him, <hi>but Madam</hi> d'Olonne <hi>upon granting me enjoyment, exacted from me not to speak thereof to you nor to</hi> Fiesque, <hi>much less then to any others, because she said that you are malicious, and</hi> Fiesque <hi>jealous. How indiscreet soever a person is, there is no Intrigue but what's kept secret in the beginning, if there be no need of a Confident: This I have had experience of in this Occasion, for I am naturally enough incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to tell an amourous adventure: And yet I have been three dayes without acquainting you with this, tho you know all my secrets; but have patience, my Dear, I am going to tell you all that passed between Madam</hi> d' Olonne <hi>and me, and by the exactest Relation in the World, in some manner requite the offence done to the friendship I have for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know then that the first Visit made her, after having written to her the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have seen, I did not find in her looks any aversion or kindness; and the Company that was at her house hindred me from having any further information. All that I could remarke was, that she obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me from time to time; but returning thither the day after, and having found her
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:150088:85"/> alone, I represented my love to her so well, and so eagerly pressed her to make returns to it, that she Confessed she loved me, and promised to give me marks thereof upon Condition I have newly told you. You know very well that I would promise her all in those moments; we heard a noise, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> bid me come again the next day dressed in Womens Cloathes, and as one who brought her Lace to sell; whereupon being returned to my House, I found you there, and you might easily perceive by the cold reception I made you, that all the World importuned me at that time, and particularly you, my Dear, whom I was more jealous of than any one; you likewise perceived it, and it was that which made you suspect I did not tell you all: when you was gone, I gave order that my Porter should say I was not at home, and prepared my self for my Mascarade of the Morrow: All the pleasure that imagination can give beforehand, I had for four and twenty hours together: The four or five last hours were more tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than all the others; at length that which I expected with so much impatience, being come, I caused my self to be carryed to Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s House, I found her
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:150088:86"/> in a Cornet upon her Bed, in a Rose Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour Undress. I cannot express to you my Dear, how beautifull she was that day, all that can be said, comes short of the Charms she had: her Neck was half uncovered, she had more Hair loose than usual, and all in rings and curles, her Eyes were more sparkling than the Stars. Love and the colour of her Face animated her Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion with the finest Vermillion in the World. <hi>Well, my Dear, said she to me, are not you full of acknowledgment that I spare you the pains of sighing a long time? do you find that I make you pay too dear for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours you receive? Tell me my Dear,</hi> added she, <hi>but you are mute. Ah! Madam</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered I her, <hi>I should be insensible were I in cold Blood, seeing you in this posture. But may I assure my self, said she, that you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten little</hi> Beauvais <hi>and the Countess of</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esque? <hi>yes</hi> said I to her, <hi>Madam, you may; and how should I remember others,</hi> added I, <hi>since you may perceive I have almost forgot my self? I only fear,</hi> replyed she, <hi>the future; for for the present, my Dear, I am much mistaken if I suffer you to think of any Body besides my self;</hi> And in finishing these words she took me about the Neck, and pressing me you know how with her Arms, she
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:150088:86"/> pulled me upon her; Both of us lying in manner, we kissed ill one another a thousand times: But not willing to stop there, and this seeking for something more solid; but on my part in vain. We ought to know our selves, and what we are fit for: For my part I perceive I am no Womans man. It was impossible for me to come off with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, what effect soever my fancy made, and the Idea and the presence of the most beautifull Object in the World. <hi>What's the matter</hi> said she to me, <hi>My Lord, What ales you, What is it that puts you in so sad a Condition?

Certainly I am bewitched.</hi> In stead of giving me an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer she called her Chamber-Maid, <hi>Prethee tell me</hi> Quentine <hi>how do I look to day? am not I very ugly?

After having made all the gestures
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:150088:87"/> she used to do when she designed to Charm any one to judge if my insufficiency procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from her fault or mine. She got up and shaked her Petticoat that was something ruffled, and went in a fury into her Closet that stood by her Bed-side. For my part, I was like a Condemned Man, I asked my self if all that had passed was not a Dream, with all the reflections that one can make in such an Encounter; I went to <hi>Manicamps</hi> House, where having related to him all my adventure. <hi>I am mightly obliged to you, my Dear</hi> said he to me, <hi>for certainly it was for the love of me that you were so insensible near so pretty a Woman.

                  <p>IF I was a lover of Venereal pleasures, I should lament my having been disappointed, but far from complaining; I am obliged to your insufficiency, it is the cause that in the expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of delights you were not able to give me, I enjoyed others by imagination that lasted much longer than those you could have been capable of furnishing, tho you had been as well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as an other Man. I send at present to know how you do, and if you were able to get a foot to your Lodgings: It is not without reason that I make this inquiry, for I never saw a Man under such sad Circumstances as you were when I left you. I Counsel you to settle your Affairs with more natural heat than you had when I saw you; for you cannot live much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Really my Lord, you raise my pity, and what outrage soever I have received from you, I shall not forbear giving you good advice. Avoid <hi>Manicamp</hi> if you are wise, you may recover your health, if you leave off seeking him for some time, it is certainly from him that your impotence proceeds: for my part neither my Glass nor my looks belying me, I do not fear being either accused or reproached.</p>

                  <p>I <hi>Confess, Madam I have had failings in my lifetime, for I am a man, and still young; but I never had a worse than that last Night. It is not to be excused Madam, and tho your sentence be never so severe, it can be but what I have deserved: I have killed, I have betrayed, I have committed sacriledge; for all these Crimes you need only seek out punishments, if you please, my Death, I will bring you my sword; if you only condemn me to be whipt, I will come naked to you in my shirt; Remember Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, that I failed in Power, not in Will; I was like a Brave soldier who finds himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arms when he should engage: I should be extreamly puzzel'd Madam, to tell you from whence this prov'd; perhaps it happend' to me as it does to those whose stomack is gone when they expect to eat most, perhaps the force of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation consumed the force of Nature. See what it is, Madam, to be so Charming. An Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Beauty who should not have troubled the Course of nature, would have been better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Adieu, Madam, I have nothing more to say to you, but that perhaps you would pardon me what is past, if you would give me the opportunity of doing better herafter, to which purpose I only demand till to morrow at the same hour as yesterday.</hi>

            <p>After having sent by one of my Footmen these fair promises to Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s Lacquis, who waited for an answer at my House, I went home, and not doubting, but that my offers would be kindly received, I resolved to take all imaginable Care of my self: I bathed and was rubbed with Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I eat new laid Eggs and Artichoaks, and then drunk some Wine; I walked a while in my Chamber, and then went to Bed without <hi>Manicamp.</hi> My Head was so full of the design of repairing my fault that I shun'd my Friends as I would have done the Plague. I got up the next day brisk both in Body and mind, I dined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and eat what was Provocative, but as little as I had done at Supper; and having spent the Afternoon in preparing my little Equipages of Love, I went to Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s House, at the same hour as the time before. I found her upon the same Bed, which made me immediately appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that it portended me some ill Fortune; but in a word, having encouraged my self as much as I could, I cast my self at her Knees. She was half undrest, and held a Fan she played with. So soon as she saw me she blusht a little, without doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the late affront she had received
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:150088:89"/> and <hi>Quentine</hi> being retired, I placed my self by her upon the Bed. The first thing she did was to put her Fan before her Eyes, and that having rendred her as bold as if there had been a Wall between us both. <hi>Ah! Well,</hi> said she to me, <hi>poor Paralitick, are you come here a compleat Man to day? Ah! Madam</hi> answered I to her, <hi>let us talk no more of what is past:</hi> And thereupon thundering into her Arms, I kissed her a thousand times, and begged she would let me see her naked: after a little resistance that she made to augment my Desires, and to affect Modesty, which becomes a Woman so well, rather than out of any distrust she had of her self, she let me see all I had a mind to. I saw a curious, white, plump and the best proportioned Body in the world. After that I fell again to embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her, we already made a noise with smacking and Bussing, our hands already clasped in one another, expressed the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most tendernesses of love; already the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our loves had made the union of our Bodies, when she perceived the sad pickle I was in. It was then that seeing I continued to outrage her, she thought of nothing but vengeance; she called me all manner of ill names, she there attended me
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:150088:89"/> with the greatest violence imaginable. For my part without making either Prayers or Complaints, knowing what I had deserved, I went home in a fury and having put my self to Bed, I turned all my choler against the cause of my Disgrace.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Fury then seiz'd me, patience me forsook</l>
               <l>A Razor in my hand, enrag'd I took,</l>
               <l>But my designe I found was all in vain,</l>
               <l>Being the Author of my shameful pain.</l>
               <l>All in a fright, and quite froze up with fear,</l>
               <l>Some wrinckles of it only did appear.</l>
               <l>And towards it's Center seem'd to crow'd, I thought,</l>
               <l>And thus for refuge in my Belly sought.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>So that not being able to do any thing, the rage I was in made me talk to my self much to this purpose. Ah! Traytor, what hast thou to say, infamous part of my self, and really shameful Member, for it would be very ridiculous to give thee an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name? Tell me, have I ever obliged thee to use me in this manner? and make me receive the cruellest Affronts in the World? to make me abuse the favours that are done me? and being but two and twenty make me have the infirmities of old
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:150088:90"/> Age? while that Choler made me speak thus.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>My Eyes towards Heaven I then did ghastly turn,</l>
               <l>My cruel Fate I did lament and mourn;</l>
               <l>I saw that all reproaches were in vain</l>
               <l>To talk to it, to rocks was to complain.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I spent the Night in mortal Agonies, I knew not if I ought to write to Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> or surprise her by an unexpected Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit: at lenght after having been a long-time considering, I chose to do the last, at the hazard of finding an obstacle to our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; but I was so happy as to find her a lone, just as it grew dark. She had put her self to Bed as soon as I was gone from her; At my Coming into her Chamber I told her, <hi>Madam, I come either to dy at your feet or give you satisfaction, I begg you would not be in a rage, I know what I have merited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> who feared as much as I did such an other mischance as those that had happned to me, took care not to daunt me with reproaches; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary she told me all that might re-establish in me a good opinion of my self which I
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:150088:90"/> had almost lost; and faith, if I was enchanted, as I told her, two dayes before I broak the Charme, the third time you may imagine, added the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> that she called me no ill names at parting, as she had done the other times: This is the state of our Intrigue, which I begg you would seem to be ignorant of: <hi>Vinevil</hi> having promised him he would, they parted, the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> went to the Countess of <hi>Fiesque</hi>'s House, to whom amongst other things he said he had no thoughts of Madam <hi>d' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Gallant's Intrigue had not continued long with his new Mistress when <hi>Marsillac</hi> discovered it, tho he had so little sence, and she had taken all imaginable care to deceive him; but jealousy that serves in stead of cunning, made him discover in her less eagerness for him than was usual. Insomuch that having made her some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Complaints in the beginning, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards more sharp ones, seeing at length they did not at all restrain her, he resolved to revenge himself at one blow, both of his Rival and his Mistress. Whereupon he gave his friends, Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and desired them to show 'em in all Companies. Mademoiselle <hi>d' Orleans</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:150088:91"/> the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> extreamly. He gave her the Letter the Count had written to his Mistress, in which he had spoken ill of the Queen and the Duke of <hi>Orleans.</hi> The first thing the Prince did was to show the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thinking to animate him so much the more against him, for that she knew that Prince had had a great kindness for him: however that Prince was not in so great a passion as she hoped he would have been, and contented himself with telling <hi>Pequelain</hi> that his Cosin was ungrateful that he had never given him reason to talk of him as he did, and that all the resentment he should have of it was, to have no longer the same esteem for him he had had; but if the Queen knew after what manner he had talked of her, she would not certainly have so much moderation as she had. The Princess not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well pleased to see his Royall highness so favourable, to the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to tell the Queen, and having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted one of her Confidents with her design, the Marshal of <hi>Grammont</hi> came to hear of it. He went and beseeched her not to ruine his son; she promised him she would not, and kept her word. This Princess was haughty and did not easily pardon
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:150088:91"/> People, who had not for her all the respect her illustrious Birth and extraordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit obliged all the World to; but when she was once perswaded they loved her, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was so good natured as she.</p>
            <p>While that the Marshall and his Friends were endeavouring to stifle the Noise that <hi>Marsillac</hi> had made with the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Letter, Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> was known to show this for the breaking of a Marriage that made <hi>Marsillac</hi>'s fortune.</p>
            <p>You do not think, Madam of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint I am in, I am forced to go two or three times a Week to visit Mademoiselle <hi>de Rochegayon,</hi> to talk to her as if I loved her, and to this purpose must spend that time I ought only to employ in seeing, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and thinking of you: and in what Condition soever I may be, it would be a great trouble to me to be obliged to keep company with a Child: but now that I live only for your sake, you may very well imagine that it is to me the cruellest of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: that which makes me take patience <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:150088:92"/> more if it was possible than I do at present.</p>
            <p>This at first surprized all the World: Thitherto indiscreet Gallants had only been found, and never Mistresses: They could not imagine that a Woman to revenge her self of a Man she no longer loved, would help one in that manner to convict herself. This indiscretion had not however the effect that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> had promised herself: Monsieur <hi>de Liancourt,</hi> Mademoiselle <hi>de la Rochegayon</hi>'s Father, knowing that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> was desirous to incense him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Marsillac,</hi> answered those who spoke to him of that Letter, That were it not for offending God, <hi>Marsillac</hi> could not do better than apply himself to gain the Heart of so beautyful a Lady as Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> that this was not the first time that Wives were spoke ill of at Mistresses Bed-side: But as the passion Men had for her, was more voilent than that they had for others, it did not usually last so long: As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that of <hi>Marsillac</hi> was not so fixed to Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and he still loved Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiselle <hi>de la Rochegayon.</hi> So that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> did not spoil <hi>Marsillac</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as she hoped to have done; and only confirming what he had said of her; sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:150088:92"/>
            <p>Things being in these termes and the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> remaining Master in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> went one Evening to the Countess of <hi>Fiesque,</hi> she prayed her to make her acknowledgments to the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> for some service she pretended to have received from him, and to exaggerate very highly the obligation she had to him: But the Abbot being one of the principal Personages of this History, it is requisite to describe how he was made.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:150088:94"/> of the late King, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth's Father, Wife of <hi>Gaspard</hi> Duke of <hi>Chastillon,</hi> had black and lively Eyes, a little Forehead, a handsome Nose, a red Lip, and full Mouth, her Complexion was as she thought fit, but she had usually white and red, she was so Charming when she smiled, that she set all hearts on a flame; her Hair was very black, she was tall, ahd a good Aire, but long, dry, and black hands, her Arms were flat, and of the same colour, which made People draw ill Conclusions of those parts they did not see: She had a loft and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wit, was insinuating and given to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, was faithless, interessed and uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Friendship; and yet what Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence soever Men had had of her ill Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when she had a mind to Charm, it was impossible for them to forbear loving her; she had some ways with her that were very tempting, and others that made her be despised by all People; for Money and Honours she would have dishonoured her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and have sacrificed Father, Mother, and Lovers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gaspard d' Coligny,</hi> and since Duke of <hi>Chastillon,</hi> after the Death of the Marshal his Father, and of his eldest Brother, fell in Love with Mademoiselle <hi>de Bouteville;</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:150088:94"/> and being the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> fell likewise in love with her, <hi>Coligny</hi> desired him to break off his Amour, since his Highnesses design was only Gallantry, and he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Marraige. The Prince being <hi>Coligny</hi>'s Relation and Friend, could not civilly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse him his demand; and as his Passion was of a very fresh date, he did not find it difficult to get rid of it: He not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <hi>Coligny</hi> that he would think of her no more, but that he would serve him in this Affair against the Marshal his Father, and his Relations who opposed it; and indeed not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the Orders of Parliament, and all the Obstacles that the Marshal his Father was able to raise against it, the Prince assisted <hi>Coligny</hi> so well, then of that Name, but since the death of his Father called <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon,</hi> that he made him carry away Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiselle <hi>de Bouteville,</hi> and lent him Twenty thousand Francks for his Maintenance. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny</hi> carried his Mistress to <hi>Chasteau-Thierry,</hi> where he Consummated the marriage: From thence they proceeded farther, and went to <hi>Steny,</hi> a Town of Safety, which the Prince, whom it belonged to, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, for their abode.▪ whether that <hi>Coligny</hi> did not find his Mistress so full of Charms as he had fancied in her, or that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:150088:95"/> Love being satisfied, he had time to reflect on the ill Condition his Fortune was in, or that he feared he had given his Wife the Disease he had, he fell into a terrible Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy on the Morrow after his Marriage: And while he was at <hi>Steny,</hi> his Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued upon him to that degree, that he was as constant to the Woods as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage. Two or three days after he went to the Army, and his Wife into a Convent of the Religieuses, two Leagues from <hi>Paris.</hi> It was thither that <hi>Roquelaure,</hi> knowing the Necessity she was in, sent her a Thousand broad Pieces, and <hi>Vinevil</hi> two thousand Crowns, which Sums are still owing to them, tho the Dutchess is very rich, and that Money was employed to her own use.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coligny</hi> being under Age when he married his Wife, it rendred his Marriage invalid, but being of Age at his Return, a Contract of Marriage was made in the <hi>Hostel</hi> of <hi>Condé</hi> before all the young Ladies Relations, and they were afterwards married in <hi>Nostre Dame</hi> by the Coadjutor of <hi>Paris.</hi> Sometime after Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> being indisposed, went to the Wells, where she met with the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> who fell in love with her.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:150088:95"/>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> had very white Hair, a handsome Nose, a little Mouth, and of a fine Colour, and was the prettiest shape Man imaginable: The least of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions was attended with an unexpressible Grace, his Humour was gay, wanton and toying, and his Will was admirable brisk and quaint. The liberty of seeing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother at all hours, which Custom has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in Places where the Waters are taken, gave a thousand opportunities to the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> of acquainting his Mistress with his Passion: But knowing that an Amorous Intrigue was never better regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, at least with Ladies we have some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem for, than by making a Declaration by word of Mouth or by Writing: He resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to speak; and being one day alone with her at her Lodgings, <q rend="margQuotes">I have been above three weeks, Madam, said he to her, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering whether I should tell you the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression your Charms have made upon my heart; and when I determined at length to acquaint you with it, it is after having seen all the Difficulties that I can find in this Design: I do my self Justice, Madam, and for that reason I ought not to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any hopes. Besides, you have lately married a beloved Lover, and it is a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:150088:96"/> Enterprize to remove him out of your heart, and to put my self in his place. However I love you, Madam, and tho you should not to be ungrateful, make use of that reason against me, I confess that it is my Star, and not my Choice that obliges me to love you. Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had had so much joy as this Discourse gave her. Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> appeared</q> to her so lovely, that if it had been the Custom for Women to have made Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Love first, she would not have deferred it so long as her Gallant did. But the fear of not seeming modest enough per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed her so extreamly, that she was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time without knowing what Answer to make. At length forcing herself to speak for the concealing the disorder that her si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence made appear; <q rend="margQuotes">You are in the right my Lord, said she to him, with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable postures, to believe that I love my Husband very much; but give me leave to tell you, that you do your self wrong in being so Modest as you are: And if I was in a Condition to acknowledge the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness you have for me, you would see that others esteem you more than you do your self. Ah! Madam, replyed the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> it is in your power, Madam, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:150088:96"/> only in yours, to make me the most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and most esteemed Man in <hi>France.</hi> He</q> had hardly finished these words, then that the Countess of <hi>Maure</hi> came into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, before whom it was requisite to change Conversation, tho these two Lovers did not change their thoughts; Their distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and disorder made the Countess of <hi>Maure</hi> judge that their Intrigue was much more advanced than it really was, and for this reason she was preparing to make a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry short Visit, when the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> prevented her. The amorous and discreet Prince well knowing that he acted but an ill part before such a sharp-sighted Woman as the Countess of <hi>Maure</hi> was, went out, and being got home, he wrote this Letter to his Mistress.</p>

                     <hi>I Leave you, Madam, that I may be more with you then I was; the Countess of</hi> Maure <hi>observed me, and I durst not look upon you; and she being cunning, I was even afraid that my Affection would discover me; for in short, Madam, it is so well known that People must eye you when they are in the same p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:150088:97"/> have the liberty of acquainting you only with it. How happy should I be, Madam, were I able to perswade you, to the point it is, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just would you be in that case, Madam, if you had not some kindness for me.</hi>

            <p>Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> was very much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed at the receipt of this Letter; she knew not whether she had best be cruel or kind. Kindness might gain the heart of her Lover, and Severity his esteem, and both might disgust him. At length she resolved to do what was most difficult, as being most honest: And notwithstanding all that her heart inspired her with, she chose rather to follow the counsel of her Reason: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she made the Duke no Answer; and as he came on the Morrow into her Chamber, <hi>Are you come again my Lord,</hi> said she to him, <hi>to commit some new Offence? because my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and looks are easie and soft, you think there is no more to do than falling on: And if your esteem is only to be purchased by rudeness, set that value on it as to constrain my self for some time: Yes, my Lord, I shall be angry, and I perceive I must be so with you.</hi> These last words were as a Thunder-clap fallen upon this poor Lover; tears came into his Eyes, and his tears spoke much better for him
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:150088:97"/> than all he could have said. After having been a moment without speaking,
<q>I am infinitely grieved, Madam, answered he her, to see you thus in anger; and I wish I was dead since I have displeased you. You shall see, Madam, that in the Vengeance I am resolved to take of the offence you have received, that your interests are much more dear to me than my own; I am going so far from you, Madam, that my Love shall no longer importune you. This is not what I require of you, interrupted that fair One, you may still stay here, without displeasing me. Cannot you see me without telling me you love me, or at least without writing me it? No, no, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, replyed he, it is absolutely impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Well then, my Lord, I consent that you see me, replyed Madam <hi>de Chastillon;</hi> but observe well all that I do for you. Ah! Madam, interrupted the Duke, throwing himself at her feet, if I have adored you when you were so cruel, judge what I shall do when you are kind: Yes, Madam, be pleased to guess at it, for it is impossible for me to express the sense I have of it.</q> This Conversation did not end as it began: Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> dispensed herself from keeping all the rigour she had promised her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:150088:98"/> and if the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> had not great Favours, at least he had hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beloved. In confidence of this he was no sooner got home, then that he wrote this Letter to his Mistress.</p>

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> received this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:150088:98"/> with such a joy, as put him almost out of himself, he kissed it a thousand times, not being able to forbear reading of it. In the mean time the Passion of these two Lovers augmented every day; and Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> who had already yielded up her heart, no longer defended the rest, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to render it the more considerable by the difficulty. In short, the time of taking the Waters being passed, they were to part, and tho they both returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> they both imagined they should not see one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again with so much Conveniency as they had done at <hi>Bourbon:</hi> In the view of these Difficulties their Farewel was very moving! The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> assured his Mistress more by his tears that he should ever love her, than by the things he said to her; and the constraint that Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> used not to weep, had the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in her Lover: They parted very sad, but deeply perswaded that they would love one another passionately, &amp; that they should ever do so. They seldom met the rest of the Autumn, because they were observed; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ent and told the Dutchess of it. <hi>The
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:150088:100"/> service that I have devoted, said he, to the Family of his Grace your Husband, obliges me to come and give you an advice which is of Consequence. Beautyfull as you are, Madam, it is impossible but that you must have adorers, and as certainly your intentions being good, you have not so strict a raine over your own actions; most Women who envy you, and Men jealous of the Glory of the Duke your Husband, give an ill interpretation to all you do. My Lord your Husband, himself has perceived that your Conduct, which tho it were more imprudent than Criminal, does not faile however to do you an injury in the World, and trouble him: you know how haughty he is, Madam, and how much he would fear to be ridiculed upon that point: I give you notice of it, and humbly beseech you to take care; for if by relying too much upon the clearness of your Conscience, you should be too negligent of your Reputation, his Grace may come to such Violences against you, as would not leave you in a Condition to make appear to him your innocence. What you tell me, Sir,</hi> answered Madam <hi>de Chastillon, ought not to surprize me; my Lord Duke began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to accustom me to his Caprichio's: On the day after our Wedding, he fell into so furious a jealousy of</hi> Roquelaure, <hi>who had helped him to carry me away, that he could not conceal it;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:150088:100"/> and yet he could never have had less reason than at what he gave him; and now again I find that he renews his suspicions, and yet I cannot devine of whom it is: All that I can say is, that I doubt whether his mind would be at rest, tho I were in the Countrey and saw none but my Domesticks. I shall not come to further parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars with you, Madam. I even know not whether my Lord Duke aimes at any one, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e tells me he is satisfied with you; but you may upon what I have told you take measures for your Conduct.</hi> And thereupon having taken leave of her, he left her under terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble disquiets. She immediately gave notice of all this to the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> and they resolved together that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain themselves more than they had thitherto done.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> was wholly taken up in Contriving how to reduce the People of <hi>Paris</hi> by Famine, to deliver the Parliament, that had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised a sum to those who would bring the Cardinals Head, fancyed that the taking of <hi>Charenton</hi> would much advance this Success, which <hi>Clanle</hi> guarded with five or six hundred Men: he reassembled part of the Quarters, and with a thousand Men, at the head of whom <hi>Gaston</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:150088:101"/> King's Unkle, and Lieutenant General of the Regency, would needs place himself, he came to Attack <hi>Charenton</hi> in three places. As the Retrenchments at the <hi>Avenues</hi> were but bad, it was not difficult for the King's Troops to force them. But the Duke of <hi>Chastillon,</hi> who commanded the Attacks under the Prince was wounded in the belly with a Musket shot in the Burrough, of which he dyed the Night after. The Prince regretted him extreamly, and his grief was so violent that it could not last. By what had passed you may judge that the Dutchesses Affliction was not very great, and you may judge it much better by what shall happen in the sequel; however she wept, she tore her Hair, and made appear the Appearances of the greatest Despair i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable, the Publick was so deceived, that this Sonnet was made upon his death.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Just as the Court the Honours did prepare</l>
               <l>That <hi>Chastillon</hi> had merited by his Arms,</l>
               <l>Death did deprive us of this Conquerour,</l>
               <l>And snatch'd him from the midst of great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>How great was, fairest Dutchess, your Despair,</l>
               <l>When you had lost all hopes of his return,</l>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:150088:101"/>
               <l>All must have wept who saw you tare your Hair,</l>
               <l>Or else their Hearts with Love did ever burn.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In such a sad Estate, so strange surprize</l>
               <l>Never <hi>Alcionne,</hi> nor <hi>Artenise</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Of Fate with so much reason could complain:</l>
               <l>You sigh, you weep, but all's, alas in vain.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> who was better informed than the rest of the World, was not astonished at Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi>'s af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction: He timed his business so well, that the excess of grief had altered in that poor despairing fair One, and was so earnest with her to grant him Enjoyment, that the fear she had had of her Husband, had hindred her from allowing him during his life, that she made an Assignation with him on the day of his Burial. <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> one of her Women, who fancied that the Duke's death would ruin the Fortune of <hi>Ricoux,</hi> who sought her in Marriage, was under a real Affliction; insomuch that when she saw the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> upon the point of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the least Favours from her Mistress, on a day that the most dissolute constrain themselves, the horrour of this action re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled her grief, and without going out of the Chamber, she disturbed the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:150088:102"/> of those Lovers by her sighs and by her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ars. The Duke well-seeing that if he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>not appease this Woman, he should not have for the future in his Amour all the sweetness that he wished for, took care to comfort her, at his going out, and told her that he was sensible of the loss she had of the Duke; but that he would be a Friend to her, and take care of her Fortune as the deceased had done; and that she should find as much good will in him as she had done in the other, and perhaps more power; and that till he could do something considerable for her, he desired her to receive Four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns that he would send her on the morrow. These words had so much virtue that <hi>Bordeaux</hi> wiped away her tears, and promised the Duke to enteresse herself for him as long as she lived; and told him that her Mistress had all the reason in the World not to spare any thing for the giving him marks of her Love. On the Morrow <hi>Bordeaux</hi> had the Four thousand Crowns which the Duke had promised her, and since that time she served him preferably to all those who would not give her so much.</p>
            <p>The Peace being made, in the beginning of the Spring, the Court returned to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> The Prince, who had newly freed the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:150088:102"/> Cardinal out of a dangerous business, sold him his Services at a very dear rate, that he had done him in that War. The Cardinal was not only unable to perform what he da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly demanded of him; but was not able to support the Insolence with which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Favours: The Government of <hi>Pont de Letreht,</hi> that the Prince had forced from him for his Brother in Law the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> contrary to the intention of the Court, and the boldness with which he had exacted from the Queen that she should see <hi>Gersé,</hi> after the confidence he had had to write an Amorous Ticket to her Majesty, made the Cardinal at length resolve to free himself from the tyranny he was under, under pretext of revenging the Contempt that was had of the Royal Authority; he communicated this Design to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who remembred his Exempt's bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Staff by the Prince, and who for that and the jealousie of his great Merit, had reasons to hate him; and the Cardinal let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him know that <hi>Riviere,</hi> who governed him, was the Prince's Pensioner, he made him give his word that he would conceal this Affair from his Favourite. The Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> their Brother in Law, were
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:150088:103"/> took into Custody in the Palace where the King then lodged: In the mean time Monsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur <hi>Thurenne,</hi> who for the Engagements he had with the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> had reason to fear being taken, and who besides was enraged against the Court for the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Sedan,</hi> which his Family was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of, withdrew to <hi>Sthney,</hi> where Madam <hi>de Longueville</hi> arrived presently after, and the Prince's Officers cast themselves into <hi>Bellegarde;</hi> Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> applyed herself to the Princess Dowager, and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> her Lover in her Interests.</p>
            <p>Sometime after that the Princes were in Prison. The Princess Dowager had leave to go stay at her Cosins Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi>'s. A Priest called <hi>Cambiac,</hi> who had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced himself to Madam <hi>de Bouteville</hi>'s, by the means of Madam <hi>Brienne,</hi> was sent to Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> by her Mother; he had not been there long, but that he governed her, insomuch that he interposed between her and the Duke of <hi>Nemours.</hi> This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce giving him occasion of having great Familiarities with Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> he fell in love with her, and to that degree, as to faint away as he was saying Mass. The Princess Dowager falling into that fit of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:150088:103"/> Sickness, which she died of, <hi>Cambiac,</hi> who had acquired great Credit with her, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed it in favour of Madam <hi>de Chastillon:</hi> He procured her a hundred thousand Crowns worth of Jewels, and the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Marlou</hi> for her life, which was worth two thousand pounds a year. The Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> whom the cares of <hi>Cambiac</hi> for Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> had something a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd, was quite jealous at the News of the Princesses Will. He did not believe that it was easie to resist such considerable Service; and though he could not blame his Mistress for having received them, he was enraged that she was obliged for them to a Man whom he considered as his Rival. And he was not mistaken; for what <hi>Cambiac</hi> had done had cost that fair One Favours; for though she loved the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> best, she loved Riches best of all. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as she had no longer occasion for <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biac</hi> after the Princesses death, it was not difficult for her to set her Lovers mind at rest, by turning off that poor Priest.</p>
            <p>The Coadjutour of <hi>Paris,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Chevreuse,</hi> who had been in the Plot of seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Princess, finding that the Cardinal became too insolent, caused the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to take it into consideration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented

Madam <hi>de Chevreuse</hi> would have had the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> for whom the Court had demanded a Cardinals Cap at <hi>Rome,</hi> to have married her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the Coadjutour would be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated to the nomination of the Prince. It was upon this promise that the Princess of <hi>Condé</hi> and <hi>Conty</hi> gave under their hands to Madam <hi>de Chevreuse,</hi> that she and the Coadjutour endeavoured to free them out of Prison. The thing having succeeded as they had projected; and the Cardinal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self having been constrained to leave <hi>France,</hi> the Prince had no moderation in his new Prosperity, and this obliged the Court to entertain new Designes upon his Person. He withdrew immediately to his House at <hi>Saint Maure,</hi> and sometime after to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond,</hi> and from thence to his Government of <hi>Guyenne.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and Madam <hi>de Longueville,</hi> who was with her Brother, being taken with his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:150088:104"/> Merit, had so much Complaisance for him, that this Prince, tho very much in love else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, could not resist her; but yielded through the weakness of the Flesh, rather than the inclination of the heart. The Duke of <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi> who had been for three years the beloved Gallant of Madam <hi>de Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueville,</hi> saw the Infidelity of his Mistress with all the rage that can be had in such like Occasions. But she being full of a great Passion for the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> was not at all careful to please her ancient Lover. The first time that she saw the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> in private, she asked him in the most passionate moment of the Assignation, what had passed between him and Madam <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon:</hi> The Duke having answered her that he had not had any Favour: <hi>Ah! I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi> said she to him, <hi>since in the Posture we are in at present, you have the power to conceal the truth.</hi> This Commerce did not last long, and the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> not being able to force himself to pretend love where he had none; and you may imagine that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, who was nasty, and had an ill smell with her, could not conceal her ill Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from a Man, who was infinitely in love elsewhere. These Disgusts did likewise further the Journey that the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:150088:105"/> was to make into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to bring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Succour of Strangers to the Princes Party: But the real cause of his impatience was, to see Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> again, whom he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loved more than his life; whereupon he passed through <hi>Paris,</hi> where he saw her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and put her into that wretched Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that may be called the Shipwrack of Widows. When she perceived her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, she sought for the means to be freed from it. <hi>Des Fougerets,</hi> a famous Physician, undertook this Cure, and while he had her in hand, the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> returned from <hi>Guyenne</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> and brought <hi>la Rochefou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cault</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>The Prince had lively Eyes, a Hawks and sharp Nose, hollow lean Cheeks, a long Face, and the Physiognomy of an Eagle, frizled Hair, his Teeth were ill set and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, a careless Aire, had but little care of his Person, but was well shaped; his Wit had a great deal of flame, but was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, he laughed much and disagreably, his <hi>Genius</hi> was admirable for War, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for Battails. On the day of Battail he was mild to Friends, and fierce to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: He had an unparallel'd neatness of Wit, force of Judgment, and easiness of Expression; he was Roguishly inclined, but
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:150088:105"/> had Faith and Probity in great Occasions: He was naturally insolent and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, but Adversity had taught him how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When the Prince fell in love with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> she was in the hands of <hi>Des Fougorests,</hi> who made use of Vomits to free her of those ill Circumstances. The Prince, who was continually at her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:150088:106"/> late Duke of <hi>Chastillon,</hi> that without the Prince's protection he would have suffered some Violences, and <hi>Chastillons</hi> hatred for him, had sufficiently disposed his Wife to love him. But let us leave <hi>Vinevil</hi> for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and return to the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Jealousie so transported him, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one day found the Prince at Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi>'s whispering with her, he all scratched his hands without perceiving what he did; and it was one of his Servants who made him take notice of the Condition he had put himself in. At length, not being able to suffer the Prince's Visits to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, he desired her to go for some time to her Country House. She loving him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, and not thinking that a short ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence would cool the Prince's Passion, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him his request; and likewise promised him to turn off <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> who had quitted his Interests for to be for those of his Rival. Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> was not long in the Country; and at her Return, the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> was jealous to that degree, that he was twenty times upon the point of causing the Prince to draw; and he would at length have been overcome with this Temptation, had it not been for the Duel he fought with
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:150088:107"/> his Brother in Law, in which he lost his Life.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> who of twenty Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers she had favoured in her life time, had never loved any so much as the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> was really grieved for his death. One of her Friends, who brought her the News of it, told her at the same time, that it was requisite that she should get out of one of Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> his <hi>Valet de Chamber</hi>'s hands, a Cabinet full of her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. She sent for him, and upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise she made him of giving him five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crowns, she got the Cabinet from him, but the poor Fellow could never get any of the Money.</p>
            <p>As for the Prince, what obligation soever he had to the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> jealousie had so disunited them, that he was very glad of his death. Glory as well as Love had caused so much Emulation between them, that they could not bear with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and this is so true, that if the Prince had had a mind to have taken all the Precautions necessary to hinder the Duke o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <hi>Nemours</hi> from fighting, he might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Duel. One thing more which made appear that there was more of Glory than of Love in the Prince's Heart, was tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:150088:107"/> a moment after the death of his Rival, he hardly loved Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and contented himself with keeping measures of Civility with her, to make use of her upon occasion, and when he should think convenient.</p>
            <p>And indeed at that time, the Cardinal thinking that she governed the Prince, sent the Great Provost of <hi>France</hi> to her, to offer her from him an hundred thousand Crowns ready Money, and the Place of Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of the future Queens Family, in case she would oblige the Prince to grant the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles he desired, and abandon the Count <hi>d' Oignon,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi> and President <hi>Viole.</hi> During the Negotiation of the Grand Provost, an Officer of the Guards, called <hi>Mouchette,</hi> negotiated like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise on the Queens part with Madam <hi>de Chastillon;</hi> but she, seeing that she could not perswade the Prince to do the things that the Count desired, sent the Queen word that she counselled her to grant the Prince all that he should desire of her, and that afterwards her Majesty would know well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough how to deal with a Subject, who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantage of the disorder of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of his Master, had forced from her shameful Conditions, and such as wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:150088:108"/> prejudicial to her Authority.</p>
            <p>At that time, the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> having been taken by the Enemies, was brought to the Palace of <hi>Condé;</hi> he had a very sharp Conversation with the Prince, but on the morrow things began to cool, and some days after the Treaty of Peace was renewed with him. As he was a Prisoner upon pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol, and that he went every where he had a mind to, he made some Visits to Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> believing that nothing could be done with the Prince but by her interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; and it was in those Visits that he fell in love with her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vinevil</hi> governed then Madam <hi>de Chastil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> pretty peaceably; <hi>Cambiac</hi> was retired since that the Prince was in love, and that the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> was dead, and this had very much diminished the Prince's Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; insomuch that some days after having been constrained to retire into <hi>Flanders</hi> by the accommodation of <hi>Paris,</hi> he was upon the point of departing without taking leave of Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> and when at length he went to see her, he was but a moment with her.</p>
            <p>The King being returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> fancied that if Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> stayed there, he should have Rivals
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:150088:108"/> upon his back, who might be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; insomuch that he perswaded the Cardinal to send her away, saying that she would every day set on foot a thousand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues against the Interests of the Court, which she could not do elsewhere; and this obliged the Cardinal to send her to <hi>Marlou:</hi> The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> went thither as often as he could; but there were in her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood two men who made her yet more frequent Visits; The one was my Lord <hi>Crofts</hi> an Englishman who had hired a House near <hi>Marlou,</hi> where he usually kept his Equipage, and where he came to ly some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and the other was <hi>Digby</hi> Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Isle of Man:</hi> These two Noble men fell in love with the Dutchess; <hi>Crofts</hi> was a peacable Man and addicted to Pleasures, and <hi>Bristol</hi> was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aughtly, brave and full of ambition.</p>
            <p>When that <hi>Cambiac</hi> had seen the Prince go out of <hi>France,</hi> he had made his appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to Madam <hi>de Chastillon;</hi> insomuch that he stayed with her at <hi>Marlou;</hi> and as he was not so much afraid of the Abbot <hi>Foucquet</hi> or of <hi>Bristol,</hi> as of the Prince, he freely told Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of her carriage with all her Lovers. She, not being willing to be contradict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:150088:109"/> in her new designs, and particularly by a Party concerned, took his Remonstrances very ill; insomuch that things growing daily worse and worse between them, <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biac</hi> at length retired grumbling, and as a Man that ought to be feared. Sometime after he wrote a Letter without a Name, and with a forged Hand, in which he gave her notice of the ill they talked of her in the World. She suspected however that this Letter came from him, because he sent her word of things, that no body but she could know of. At length Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> learning from several parts that <hi>Cambiac</hi> railed against her, she desired madam <hi>Pisieux,</hi> whom she was very well acquainted with, and who had a power over him, to withdraw some Letters of Consequence that he had of hers, which Madam <hi>de Pisieux</hi> promised her to do, and at the same time sent word to <hi>Cambiac</hi> to come to her at her House at <hi>Marins</hi> near <hi>Pontoise.</hi> It is to be observed that since that <hi>Cambiac</hi> was gone from Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> she had made a thousand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints against him to my Lord <hi>Digby.</hi> This Lover, who only thought of pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Mistress, and who ruined himself in expences for her sake, did not stick at
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:150088:109"/> promising her a Vengance that should cost him nothing, and wherein he would find his particular interest: He took the time that <hi>Cambiac</hi> being at <hi>Marine,</hi> was one day on Horseback to go abroad, and having seized him with five or six Troopers, he sent him to <hi>Marlou.</hi> Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> knowing that Lovers that had been well treated ought never to be offended by halves, was much perplexed at the manner that <hi>Cambiac</hi> was now used, and perceived that no Body would be suspected but her; she was very ill satisfied with <hi>Digby,</hi> and would have sooner pardoned him the Death of <hi>Cambiac</hi> than the seizing him after this manner: But in short, not being able to undo what was done. <hi>I am extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grieved,</hi> said she to him, <hi>at what has now happened to you, I perceive that the Impertinent who has done you this Affront, would make you suspect me, by sending you to my House; but you shall see by the resentment I shall have of it, that I have no share in this Voilence; In the mean time, Sir, if you have a mind to stay here, you are Master; if you think fit to return to</hi> Marine, <hi>you shall have my Coach, you need only Command it. I know, Madam,</hi> answered <hi>Cambiac</hi> to her coolly, <hi>what I ought to think of all this; I give you
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:150088:110"/> thanks for the offers you make me; I shall return on Horseback if you think fit: God, who will defend me from the attempts of the wicked, will have care of me to the end.</hi> And having spoke these words he went away in a pett, and returned alone to <hi>Marine.</hi> He was no sooner arrived there than that he and Madam <hi>de Pisieux</hi> wrote these two Letters to one of their Friends at <hi>Paris.</hi>

Madam</hi> de Pisieux, <hi>as you know, wrote to me; and you likewise know that I undertook the journey the same day that I arrived; Madam</hi> de Chastillon <hi>sent</hi> la Fleur, <hi>to know if I was here, and on the Morrow a Man unknown under false Colours, came to ask me, and know if I would return seddenly to</hi> Paris. <hi>Yesterday I departed from hence at four a Clock; being an hundred Paces
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:150088:110"/> from</hi> Pontois, <hi>after having passed the River, I was invested by six Horsmen, with their Swords in their hands, at the head of whom was my Lord</hi> Digby. <hi>He told me immediately, that if Madam</hi> de Chastillon <hi>would have done me justice, she should have caused me to receive a hundred stabs, but that I should fear No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. I shall tell you without any Bravado, that I acted very briskly in this encounter, and that I did nothing in this Affaire that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy; he used me very civilly, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving dined, he conducted me himself to the foot of</hi> Marlou, <hi>and then sent me with four Horsmen to make satisfaction to that worthy person; she seemed to be displeased at this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and was really so at the haughtiness with which I spoke to her, which made her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that it was the worst thing she had ever done. I returned to</hi> Marine, <hi>to tell Madam</hi> de Pisieux <hi>the treachery that Madam</hi> de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon <hi>had done her as well as me. She has all the resentment that a person of her Qualisy, Honour and Courage ought to have. You see this is something an extraordinary accident, I conjure you let me know your opinion of it, and what course you think I ought to take; you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive I suppose that I ought not to rest satisfied, since that this base person has written to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> de Pisieux, <hi>to conjure her to obtain of me
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:150088:111"/> to stifle my resentment, by assuring me that she knew nothing of all this. The answer that has been made her, is worthy of the generosity of Madam</hi> de Pisieux. <hi>I am resolved to stay three or four days here, to have leizure to think of what I have to do, and to hinder my self from attempting any thing that I may repent of: Besides, to vent One's self in Complaints, is but a feeble revenge, and I have a design to do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise if I can. I impatiently long to hear from you, and am wholly yours. A Letter does not permit me to give you a very particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; I shall do it when I see you. Farewel.</hi>

                  <p>I <hi>Have too great a share in the Adventure of Monsieur</hi> de Cambiac, <hi>not to add one word of my Hand to the Relation he has given you by his; there is not a Circumstance but what is surprizing, and the best that can be thought of me in this occasion is, That they have had but little Consideration for me; for according to all appearances, I ought to have a share in so worthy an Action: The truth is, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:150088:111"/> justifies me sufficiently, since he retired into the same place where the Snare was laid for him. All my study is at present so to carry my self, that I may not be transported with a just Anger, which I shall entertain all my life time, to make appear that I was a Friend sufficiently useful to Madam</hi> de Chastillon. <hi>You know my Name and my Courage, I have ever spoke to you with sincerity enough; I moreover add, that I make profession of a very austere Christianity, and that I design to serve my God and my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster without Art and without Deceipt. These Foundations laid, I shall not be wanting in any thing that Resentment and Justice can permit me. Oblige me with imparting this to Monsieur</hi> de Aubigny, <hi>and to no others: This will be no ill Entertainment for the Princess</hi> Palatine, <hi>which I give you leave to tell it to. I do not believe that</hi> Cambiac'<hi>s Crime of returning to his Duty, by the means of the Bishop of</hi> Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, <hi>nor mine for having concealed him, were great enough to occasion so ill an Accident. I shall come on purpose to</hi> Paris <hi>to discourse my Friends in particular, and you in the first place. I cannot hold in this little word of Revenge, Madam</hi> de Chastillon <hi>is not forgotten when an occasion is offered to speak of her: I wish you happiness, I am too angry to have any to day.</hi>

            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:150088:112"/>
            <p>In a short time after these two Letters were sent, <hi>Cambiac</hi> returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> and no longer kept any measures with Madam <hi>de Chastillon;</hi> he railed at her in all Companies, and that he might fully glut his Vengeance, he showed the Queen all the most extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly passionate Letters of Madam <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon,</hi> the modesty of the History does not permit them to be repeated; but by the most civil Fragment we follow, the rest may be judged of.</p>
            <p>In several parts she let <hi>Cambiac</hi> know, that he might talk of her as he pleased, but that it was more generous in him to speak well of her than otherwise; that when a Woman lay at the mercy of People, as she did at his, they might make an ill use of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and that what a poor Woman had to do in those Encounters, was to suffer and to be silent. In another place she let him know, that notwithstanding all she did, she still loved him, and that though she was preparing to make a general Confession at <hi>Easter,</hi> there was nothing therein which concerned him.</p>
            <p>The Queen was much surprized at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Chastillon</hi>'s Extravagancy in her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, however she was not sorry at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it brought upon her; and when that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:150088:112"/> she had learnt the Insult that had been done to <hi>Cambiac,</hi> she made a great noise of it, and said publickly, That since People were so ill treated, who returned to do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the King would know how to do them justice.</p>
            <p>When my Lord <hi>Digby</hi> came to see Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> after what had been done to <hi>Cambiac,</hi> he was astonished that he only received reproaches from her, instead of the thanks that he expected. <hi>When I let you know,</hi> said he to him, <hi>my being displeased with</hi> Cambiac, <hi>it was not meant that you should use him as you did: And it is easie to see that in this fine Action you considered your self more than you did me; but I shall now be careful of my Interests, and neglect yours. Digby</hi> would have excused himself upon his Intentions, that had been good, and seeing that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all that he said to her she was not pacified, he likewise fell into a pet; and Madam <hi>de Chastillan</hi> fearing by losing him to lose a Protectour and a Lover, soothed him up, and desired him to consider at another time, that he ought to ruin quite, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble Injuries with such people as <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bias.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="144" facs="tcp:150088:113"/>
            <p>While that <hi>Digby</hi> began to fall in love with Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> my Lord <hi>Crofts,</hi> who in the time the Disorders of <hi>England,</hi> had followed <hi>Charles</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> had taken a House in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Marlou;</hi> and leisure, conveniency, and the insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ways of Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed this Lord's heart with love; but as he was of a milder disposition than the Earl, his Passion had not made such progress as the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>Things were in these terms, when that the Abbot <hi>Foucquett,</hi> seeing that his Affairs did not advance with Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> made use of this Stratagem to hastem them: He had learnt that <hi>Ricoux,</hi> Brother in Law to one of Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi>'s Women, was concealed in <hi>Paris,</hi> where he had Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with them for the Prince's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests; he sent so many People in quest of <hi>Ricoux,</hi> that he was taken and carried to the <hi>Bastille.</hi> The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> having caused him to be examined, he accused Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> of several things; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others, of having promised him ten thousand Crowns to kill the Cardinal, and said that she had already given him two thousand beforehand upon that account. The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> suppressed these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:150088:113"/> and caused others to be given, by which <hi>Ricoux</hi> still confessed that he was at <hi>Paris</hi> with design to kill the Cardinal; but did not accuse the Duchess of having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hand in this Conspiracy: And all that he said against her was, That she kept Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with the Prince, and received a Pension of Four thousand Crowns from the Spaniards. He shewed these last Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Cardinal, and the first to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> by which having, as may be imagined, extreamly terrified her, He told her he would save her, if out of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment she would give him the least marks of Love: Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> who feared death more then all things, did not stick to satisfie the Abbot <hi>Foucquett,</hi> but resisted just as long as was necessary to make him value this last Favour. The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> his whole thoughts were now, how to love his Mistress; and to that end he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her to leave <hi>Marlou</hi> one night, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her into <hi>Normandy,</hi> where he made her change her Abode every day, disguised sometimes like a Gentleman, sometimes like a Religious, and sometimes like a Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. This lasted six Weeks, during which the Abbot <hi>Foucquet</hi> went and came from Court to the place where Madam <hi>de Chastil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:150088:114"/> was: At length he procured her an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, when <hi>Ricoux</hi> had been Executed, and caused her to return to <hi>Marlou,</hi> where she was not long in repose; for she cast her Eyes upon the Mareshal <hi>d' Hocquincourt,</hi> as well for the Advantages she might draw from him by the Posts he held upon the <hi>Somme,</hi> as to free her from the tyranny of the Abbot <hi>Foucquett,</hi> who began to become insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> Marshal <hi>d' Hocquincourt</hi> had black sparkling Eyes, a handsome Nose, a little Forehead, a long Visage, and black frized Hair, and his Shape was very fine: He had but little Wit, and yet was cunning by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very distrustful; he was brave and ever in love, and his Valour served him instead of Wit and good Carriage amongst the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> knowing him by▪ Reputation, fancied that he was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Person to commit the Follies she had occasion for. Monsieur <hi>de Vignacourt,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Picardy,</hi> her Neighbour, was the Person she employed to him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Marshal having agreed with <hi>Vigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> that at his going to Command the Army of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> he would see her as he passed thorow <hi>Marlou,</hi> as if Chance had occasioned this Interview. The thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:150088:114"/> as it had been projected, and Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> took Horse to go to Conduct the Marshal two Leagues from <hi>Marlou.</hi> On the way, she related to him the sad Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of her Fortune, desired him to be her Protectour, flattered him with the Title of the Refuge of the Afflicted, and the Resource of the Miserable. In short, she so inspired him with Generosity, that he promised to serve her with and against all, and even gave her his Table-Book, in which he gave order to the Governours of Towns and Places to receive her and hers, as often as she had occasion. This Interview was discovered by the Abbot <hi>Foucquett,</hi> who seeing the Marshal <hi>d' Hocquincourt</hi> upon the point of returning to Court, judging his and Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi>'s Neighbourhood dangerous for his and the Courts Interests, perswaded the Cardinal to remove her to the Frontiers of <hi>Picardy,</hi> and caused an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be sent her to go to her Dutchy. As Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> was on her Journey, she met with the Marshal <hi>d'Hocqiuncourt</hi> at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarquis,</hi> with whom she renewed the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures she had taken six Months before, and after having mutually given one another, he positively words to protect her against the Court, and she hopes to grant him one day
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:150088:115"/> marks of her Passion. They parted, The Marshal went to find out the King, and she to her Dutchy, where she passed the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, during which the Marshal <hi>d' Hocquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> and the Abbot <hi>Foucquett,</hi> who being the most difficult Patron to be satisfied, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently supported the Interviews that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed between the Marshal <hi>d' Hocquincourt</hi> and Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> and the Commerce she kept with him. To excuse herself, she told him that the Marshal used his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with the Cardinal that she might have <hi>Bordeaux</hi> again, who was taken from her, and to obtain of him for herself, leave to return to Court: She added, That she could have wished she might not have been indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for those Favours to any other than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but that she was willing to spare his Credit for Affairs of greater moment. What perswaded the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue between the Marshal did only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Court, was that in the Spring she returned through his Intercession, first to <hi>Marlou,</hi> afterwards to <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Bordeaux</hi> with her. During the Mareshal's Campaign in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> the King of <hi>England,</hi> whom the misfortunes of his Family obliged to stay in <hi>France,</hi> and who had found the Dutchess much to his mind, saw her at <hi>Marlou</hi> in the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:150088:115"/> little Journeys he made to my Lord <hi>Crofts</hi>'s his House; and this Commerce had inspired this Prince with so much love for her, that he resolved to marry her: <hi>Crofts</hi> perswading his Master to satisfie her at any rate, upon the promises that Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> had given this Lord that he should enjoy her, in case he would contribute to the making her Queen: And indeed she had been so, if God, who took care of the Fortune and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that King, had not amused Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> with a foolish hope, which made her fail of so fair an Occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> had great black Eyes, his Eye-brows were thick, and met together, was of a brown Complexion, a handsome Nose, a long Visage, his Hair was black and curled; he was tall, and fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shaped; he had an austere Presence, and yet loft and civil more in good than in ill Fortune: He was brave, that is to say, that he had the Courage of a Souldier, and the Soul of a Prince: He was a great Wit, and loved Pleasures, but yet he loved his Duty more: In short, he was one of the greatest Kings in the World: But however, tho Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had gifted him with admirable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, Adversity, that had been his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:150088:116"/> was the principal Cause of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Merit.</p>
            <p>The Prince at his leaving of <hi>France,</hi> had shown, as I have already said, very little consideration for Madam <hi>de Chastillon;</hi> but having known the value that the Spaniards set on her, by the Pension they had given her, and the Credit that she had at the Court of <hi>France,</hi> by the means of the Abbot <hi>Fouc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quett,</hi> was reinflamed for her: And his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was so violent, that he wrote to her the most passionate Letters in the World, and amongst others, this was intercepted that he wrote to her in Cyphers.</p>

            <p>The hopes that Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> had upon this Letter of marrying the Prince, made her think of refusing the offers of the King of <hi>England;</hi> hereupon she consulted one of her female Friends in <hi>Bordeaux</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. She, whose Husband was with the Prince, told her Mistress that she was mad once to think of marrying a shaddow of a King, a Wretch who had not wherewith to live, and who in making her to be laughed at, would ruin her in a little time, that if
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:150088:117"/> it was possible, contrary to all appearances in the World, that he should one day reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Throne, she might very well believe that being weary of her, he would be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced from her upon the pretext of the inequality of Condition: Her Friend told her on the contrary, that her madness was to marry the Prince who was married, and whose Wife was in health, that persons of the Quality of the King of <hi>England</hi> might be sometimes under ill Fortune, but that they could never be in that extream necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty so common to private Persons: That it was fine for a Lady to live a Queen, tho she should live unhappy; and that she ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to refuse an honourable Title, tho she was only to bear it upon her Grave. As for you Mademoiselle, turning towards <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> you have reason to talk as you do to her Grace, considering only your own interest; but for my part, who only consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Graces, I tell her what I ought to say. Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> gave them thanks for the kindness they showed her, and told them that she would take time to think of their Reasons before she came to a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:150088:117"/> was contrary to her advice; In the mean time there came Notice from several parts to the King of <hi>England</hi> of the Life of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Chastillon,</hi> and of her present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct with the Abbot <hi>Foucquett.</hi> Never any Man that had the least sense of Honour, did lose his Reason so much as in the beginning of his Passion to marry a Woman without Honour.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> went from the Neighbourhood of <hi>Marlou</hi> as soon as He had learnt all these news, and would not hazard, by seeing Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> a Conflict that might be doubtfull between his sences and his Reason. Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> was not then sensible of the loss she had: the desires and hopes she had of marrying the Prince rendered all other things indifferent to her.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> being returned from her Dutchy to <hi>Marlou</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Spring, through the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Marshall <hi>d' Hocquincourt,</hi> and sometime after to <hi>Paris,</hi> he did not find her ungratefull for this favour. This little service and the promises he gave her of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Cardinal and putting his Places into the Princes hands, touched Madam <hi>de Chastillons</hi> Heart to that point, that she
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:150088:118"/> granted enjoyment to the Marschal. The Summer passed in this manner during, which the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> who perceived this Commerce, was often under strange dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets; and he had done at that time what he did afterwards, if Lovers did not love to deceive themselves, when they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to quit or condemn their Mistresses.</p>
            <p>The Winter after, the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> at his return from <hi>Catalonia,</hi> seemed to be in love with Madam <hi>de Chastillon;</hi> The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> allarum'd at so dangerous a Rivall, caused <hi>Boligneux</hi> to desire him to cease his persuit. The Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time really in love with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and had only engaged himself with Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> to make her serve for a pretext, easily granted the Abbot <hi>Foucquett's</hi> Request. But as with this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress Lovers were as an <hi>Hydra,</hi> of whom one head was no sooner cut off, but that an other sprung up in the room, <hi>la Feuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade</hi> took the place of the Duke of <hi>Candale;</hi> The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> who knew it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, spoke himself pretty sharply of it to la <hi>Fuillade,</hi> who whether that he fancyed that his Rival being beloved he should not succeed in his Enterprize, or whether that his blooming Passion left him all his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:150088:118"/> he did not judge it Convenient to incurr the hatred of so violent a Man; wherefore he did not persevere in that Amour. The Marquess <hi>de Cozuvres</hi> had not so much Complaisance as <hi>Feuillade</hi> had, he continued to see Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> maugre the Abbot <hi>Foucquett;</hi> but as he had neither Fortune nor Merit enough to touch her Heart, she only made a Conquest of him, and only kept him in play to inflame the Abbot <hi>Focuquett,</hi> and oblige him to renew his Presents, and let him know that she had Persons of Quality on her side who would not suffer her to be misused. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Abbot was forced to bear with this Rivall but he vented his Choler upon poor <hi>Vinevil;</hi> who was one of the first Lovers of Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> beloved, a Man of good Sense, and whose Wit was to be feared. The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> gave the Cardinal to understand that it was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to leave him at <hi>Paris;</hi> insomuch that the Cardinal seeing only through the Abbots Eyes, sent an order to <hi>Vinevil</hi> to go to <hi>Tours</hi> till further order; and he not being suffered to take his leave of Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> wrote her this Letter on the last of October 1651.</p>

            <p>Notwithstanding <hi>Vinevil</hi>'s Banishment, The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> was no more at ease than he was before, Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> making him mad every moment; but that which disquieted him most was the Intrigue between her and the Marshall <hi>d' Hocquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court.</hi> This had rendred her so haughty that she had often treated the Abbot <hi>Fouc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quett</hi> as if she had not known him.</p>
            <pb n="159" facs="tcp:150088:120"/>
            <p>During these passages the Marshal <hi>de Hocquincourt</hi> finding himself pressed by Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> to perform the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises he had made her, which not being willing to do, he gave notice to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of all that he had promised Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> by one of his Gentlemen, who seemed to betray him, and at the same time caused the same notice to be given to the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> by Madam <hi>Calvoisin,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Roye</hi>'s Wife. This peice of Cunning had the effect, that the Marshall had promised himself; the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal was alarum'd, and to break of so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an Intrigue caused the Marshal <hi>d' Hocquincourt</hi> to be treated with. The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>Foucquett</hi> for his part, having had the information from <hi>Calvoisin,</hi> desired the Cardinal that he would cause Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> to be took into Custody, and put in such a place where she might not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:150088:121"/>
               <hi>Poitow-stret.</hi> On the morrow after her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> took a Note under her hand by order from the Cardinal, and directed to the Marshal <hi>d' Hocquincourt,</hi> by which she desired him to come to an accomodation with the King, and not to think any longer of the Prince or of her, because it might endanger his Life; &amp; as some days before she was taken she had agreed with the Marshal, that in case they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be taken into custody, and that Letters were exacted from them, contrary to the measures they had taken together, they should give no Credit to them if they were not written with a double C. Which she did not do in this Letter, but she did in an other which she wrote at the same time to the Marshal; by which she let him know that he should remain firm in the first reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution that he had taken of serving the Prince, and of delivering up his Places to him; which the Marshal never▪ intended, and had only promised Madam <hi>de Chastil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> that he would, that he might obtain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from her, and to procure advantages from the Cardinal, which he could not have without making himself be feared; he suppressed the Letter of intelligence, and sent that to the Prince which the Abbot
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:150088:121"/>
               <hi>Foucquett</hi> had caused Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> to write to him, by which knowing that she was in danger of her life, he sent him word to make his peace with the Court, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he got Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> released out of Prison. The Cardinal believing the Marshal to be really in love with Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> and that he would give all that he should demand of him to set her at liberty, would have deducted upon her account an hundred thousand Livers, out of the hundred thousand Crowns they had agreed of together: But the Marshal would not consent to it, and yet that she might not think him a cheat, and to keep some measures with her still, he would not put his places into the Cardinals hands, till he knew that the Dutchess was set at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; insomuch that to satisfy him in that point, they deceived him, and sent the Dutchess to the fathers Oratory to shew her self to a Gentleman he had sent on purpose for that end; with whom she was free, after which she returned to her prison, where she was eight days longer. During the three weeks that she was a Prisoner in <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street,</hi> the Abbot was not so free as she, he became daily more and more smitten; for as with the liberty of going and coming
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:150088:122"/> he likewise deprived her of that of deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; he found her a thousand times more lovely than before. Besides the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess being willing to recover his esteem that she migh procure being set at liberty, used him after such a manner as was capable of melting the heart of a Barbarian, and had a thousand kindnesses and Complyances for him: and she seemed to put so entire a Confidence in him, that he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear beleiving that she would never depend again on any Body but him.</p>
            <p>Things being in this Posture, the Abbot surprized a very kind Letter, that the Dutchess wrote to the Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi> This grieved him so extreamly, that in reproaching her, he would have poisoned himself with Quicksilver from behind a Looking-glass; but beginning to find himself ill, he lost the desire of dying for a faithless one, and took <hi>Theriaque</hi> which he usually carried about him to secure himself from Enemies, which the employ he had about the Cardinal procured him daily. Except going where she pleased, the Dutchess passed her time very pleasantly in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; The Abbot treated her with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Delicacies, and made her daily very considerable Presents in Knacks and Jewels;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:150088:122"/> he went from thence at two a Clock in the Night, and came again at eight in the Morning, thus was he with her eighteen hours in four and twenty.</p>
            <p>It was impossible but that the Cardinal must know where the Dutchess was, and this is pleasant that this great Man, who decided the Fate of <hi>Europe,</hi> should go halves with the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> in an amourous secret: I beleive that the reason he had to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

It is easie to imagine in what allarms the Dutchess was so soon as she knew the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, and particularly when it is known that in the Letter, which she wrote to the Abbot, besides a thousand kind things, there was also a long Chapter against Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Bregi,</hi> whom she hated, because she had naturally the Charms of Body and of mind which the Dutchess had only by Art▪ It is certain thet the Dutchess had ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied her and was never able to pardon he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> which she had sent to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

As for the Marshal so soon as he had seen all the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot's Letters, and those that the Dutchess wrote to him, he judged that he might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:150088:124"/> as she did by this Letter, caught hold of it, and tore half of it off, which he went to show to the Dutchess, telling her that the Marshal had burnt the other halfe; but the Marshal being enraged at this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of the Abbots, bid him be gone im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately out of his House, and that if some respects did not withhold him, he would cause him to be thrown out of the Window.</p>
            <p>The Dutchess being sometime after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Paris,</hi> fancied that to undeceive the Publick of a thousand Particulars, that the Marshal had said of her, it was requisite that she should let People of Merit and Virtue see after what manner she would treat him. In order to which, she made choice of the House of the Marquess <hi>de Souches,</hi> Great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost of <hi>France,</hi> to whom and his Wife she had a mind to justifie herself more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly: The Assignation being made with the Marshal, he perceived her design. <hi>God keep thee, my poor Child,</hi> said he accosting her, <hi>How does my little Buttocks do, are they stil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> very lean?</hi> It is impossible to imagine the sad Condition this discourse put the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess in! she was as if she had been stund with a blow upon her head, it made her forget to call the Marshal Fool and Insolent; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:150088:124"/> she fancied that having begun as he did, he would proceed to the most shameful parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars imaginable for her, if she displeased him never so little. The Grand Provost and his Wife looked upon one another, and turning towards the Dutchess, found her with her Eyes towards the ground, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed she did not change her Colour; but those who knew her did not believe her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed. At length the Great Provost brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king silence, <hi>You do ill,</hi> said he, <hi>my Lord Marshal; Gallant men ought never to quarrel with Ladies, they ought to be thankul to them for the Presents they make them of their Hearts, and ought not to offend them when they refuse it. I grant that,</hi> said the Marshal, <hi>but when their Hearts are once given, if they change af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, it is requisite they use civilly those they have loved, and when they droll upon them, they expose themselves to great Affronts. You un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand me, Madam,</hi> added he, turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Dutchess, <hi>I am sure you believe that I have reason for what I say, but you surprize me with your disorder; you ought to be prepared for such Accidents, since you lay Snares for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who revenge themselves. I vow I would not have believed that you had so much Modesty as you have.</hi> And in ending this Discourse he went away, and left the Dutchess more dead
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:150088:125"/> than alive. The Great Provost and his Wife endeavoured to bring her to herself; telling her, That what the Marshal had said, had not made any impression upon their minds; however from that day they had no great Commerce with her.</p>
            <p>A fortnight after the Abbot was obliged to go to the Court, which was at <hi>Compeigne;</hi> The Dutchess foreseeing the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dés</hi> return into <hi>France</hi> by the general Peace that was much talked of, and not being willing that he should find her in so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an Intrigue for her, resolved to break off after such a manner, as that there might not remain the least appearance of it. In this design she went to the Abbots House, where having found one of his Servants in whom he put most confidence, and asked him for the Keyes of his Master's Closet, saying she had a mind to write him a Letter. This Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low without penetrating further, and only considering the Abbots Passion for the Dutchess, he gave her immediately what she demanded. Seeing herself alone, she broak the lock of the Cabinet where she knew that the Abbot kept her Letters, and not only took them all, but likewise others from the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> which she had sacrificed to them, and went and burnt them
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:150088:125"/> at Madam <hi>de Sourches</hi> House. The Abbot having found this disorder at his return home, went to the Dutchesses House, and began to threaten to cut off her Nose, and then broke a Christal Candlestick, and a great Looking-glass that he had given her, and went away after having called her a thousand Names. During all this bustle, one of the Dutchesses Chambermaids fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Abbot would take away from her all that he had given her, laid hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Mistresses Cabinet of Jewels, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it to Madam <hi>de Sourches</hi> House, from whence she sent for it again the same Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gave it to a devout Relation of her Mothers to keep. The Abbot having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it on the Morrow, went to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Womans House, and took it away by force. The Dutchess being informed of the loss she had, was extreamly grieved; but she did not lose her judgment, she em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed people to the Abbot, who had so much credit with him, that he restored the Cabinet; and by the means of this restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they were as well reconciled as they had ever been; and this reconciliation was so sudden, that Madam <hi>de Bouteville</hi> coming the morrow to comfort the Dutchess her Daughter for the accident that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:150088:126"/> to her, the Abbot was already with her, who concealed himself in a Closet during the Visit, and heard all the Comedy.</p>
            <p>Some time after, the Dutchess not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to take alwaies the pains to conceal that she saw the Abbot again; and fancied that since their quarrel was known abroad, their reconciliation ought likewise to be publick: Wherefore she caused all her friends to desire her to pardon the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot upon his sollicitation, and at length having made it a point of Conscience, the Mother Abbess, of the Convent of <hi>Mercy,</hi> a Woman subject to beatifical Visitations, made them see and embrace one another. This Mediation brought the Reverend Mother into some discredit with the Queen and the Cardinal: They fancyed that that she had not so particular a Commerce with God, since she suffered her self to be so easily deceived by Men.</p>
            <p>However this reconciliation lasted but six Months; The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s return into <hi>France</hi> coming on daily made the Dutchess apprehend that he would find her under the Abbots Tutorship, and the Ladies <hi>de Saint Chaumond</hi> and <hi>de Feguiers</hi> made her so much ashamed of him, that she broak with him upon a pretext of Devotion. It
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:150088:126"/> was very difficult for the Abbot to consent to the Dutchess's design, and would not have done it at an other time; but seeing his Credit very much diminished with the Cardinal, and fearing that the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who hated him besides, and <hi>Boute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> who would revenge the dishonour he had done to his family, might cause him to be stabbed, if he gave the Dutchess the least new Reason of Complaining, he left off Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but not loving her.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:150088:128"/> herself made him the same Compliment: The Abbot, being very desirons to have an Intrigue with Madam <hi>d'Olonne,</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the curing himself of the Passion he had still for the Dutchess of <hi>Castillon,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned her Civilities as obligingly as he was able; and on the Morrow the Countess ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sent to seek him, and telling him what Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> had desired her to say: <hi>I know more than you of that, Madam,</hi> said he to her, <hi>and I received yesterday Evening marks of acknowledgment from herself: But I would willingly know of you one thing,</hi> added he, <hi>Whether the Count</hi> de Guiche <hi>is not in love with Madam</hi> d' Olonne; <hi>for if he is, I will avoid the Occasion of being so: He has had so much respect for me upon all Occasions, that I should be ridiculous should I play him such a prank. No,</hi> said the Countess, <hi>at least Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> d' Olonne <hi>and he have each of them told me, that they had not any thoughts of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If this is true,</hi> replyed the Abbot, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you Madam, to let Mad.</hi> d' Olonne <hi>know that you have seen me, &amp; that upon what you have told me in her Name, I appeared to you so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with joy, to see how she received what I did for her, that you do not doubt but that I shall be infinitely in love; and thereupon, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:150088:128"/> ask her, I beseech you, what she would do in case I should be so.</hi> The Countess ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given her word that she would, the Abbot went away; and on the Morrow Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> having received a Letter from the Countess, made her this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>

I am a Friend of Madam</hi> d' Olonne'<hi>s, and nothing else,</hi> answered the Abbot, <hi>thus you have no reason to complain of me; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if I thought the Discourse you have now held to me, was by the advice of People, who had a mind to bring me into trouble, I declare to you I would become your Rival from this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Some time after
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:150088:130"/> the Abbot finding Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> at a place where he made a Visit, she took him aside, to impart to him some secrets of small moment, and the Abbot not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to say to her, told her his dispute with the Count. <hi>I am very glad,</hi> said she to him, <hi>to see that you, Gentlemen, dispose of me, as if I was your own: Thus I find I am at present the Count</hi> de Guiches, <hi>since you have made him your declaration that you have no pretences to me. Ah! Madam,</hi> answered the Abbot, <hi>I would not give you to any Body, if it was in my power to do it; as I love my self better than any one in the World, I would keep you for my self; but upon the suspicions that the Count</hi> de Guiche <hi>has, that I have a Passion for you, I declare to him that I have no such thoughts, and this betwixt you and me, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, because I trust my good Fortune, for—No, no,</hi> interrupted Madam <hi>d' Olonne, do not continue talking to me contrary to what you think; you know well enough that you are not so unhappy as you say.</hi> The Abbot finding himself so pressed, could not forbear an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering, That she knew him better than he did himself; that it being in her power to make King's themselves happy, he should think his Fortune made, if she would assure him of it; and moreover, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:150088:131"/> he had made the Count, should not hinder him from loving her, when he should see any likelyhood of being beloved.

He heard Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> saying a thousand kind things to some Body, which increasing his Curiosity, he looked through the Key-hole, and saw his Mistress making as tender Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses to her Husband, as if he had been a Lover.

                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:150088:132"/> Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> being ever full of Consideration, when she was to lose a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, not so much out of fear of his Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as because she lessened the number, told the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> that he was Master of her Conduct, that he might prescribe to her what manner of life he pleased; that if the Abbot gave him umbrage, she would not only see him no more, but if he was willing he should be witness after what rate she would rattle him. The Count, who never durst have asked her so great a Sacrifice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Offers she made him: The As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation being made to be at my Lord <hi>Croft</hi>'s House the next day; where Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> having no other Company than the Count and the Abbot, spoke to the last after this manner, after having concerted all the Evening before. <q rend="margQuotes">I desired you, Mr. Abbot, to come hither, to tell you in the presence of my Lord the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> that I do not love you, and that I can never love any Body but him; we were both very willing that you should know it, that you might not plead ignorance: Not that you have hitherto carried your self to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me otherwise than as a Friend; but as you had no design, you have not perhaps taken notice that your Visits were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:150088:132"/> too frequent, and you know tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that is not usually very pleasing to so amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Man as the Count, what confidence soever he has in his Mistress. For my part I shall spend my whole life in thinking how to please him: I was willing to make you this Declaration, lest that you without thinking, should bring your self into trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; I shall be overjoyed to have you for my Friend, but the less commerce we have together, the better it will be. Yes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I give you my word, said the Abbot▪ to her, I am very much of the Count <hi>de Guiches</hi> Opinion, I have passed through all the degrees of Jealousie, and this is not the first time that he and I have discoursed upon this point. I know the promises I made him, and I am sure I have not broken them. The truth is, interrupted the Count, that I cannot complain of you; but as her Ladyship has said very well, that as you have no design, you did not think you did contrary to what you promised me, and appearances are only against you. Well, replyed the Abbot to him, let not this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from being happy, for I give you my word that I will not. Her Ladiship designedly but once a Month, but for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters I cannot answer for them; but it
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:150088:133"/> is your part to take securities in that case.</q> After a thousand Civilitiess on all sides, they parted.</p>
               <p>It will be perhaps wondred at, that the Abbot suffered Rivals so impatiently in his Intrigues with the Dutchess of <hi>Chastillon,</hi> and was so tractable with Madam <hi>d' Olonne;</hi> but the reason is, that with the former there was love in the case, and with the latter nothing but Debauche; and that the Body can bear with Associates, which the Heart can never do.</p>
               <p>Sometime after <hi>d' Olonne</hi> being informed of the ill Conduct of his Wife, resolved to send her into the Country, as well to hinder her from committing new Follies, as to stifle the Reports which her Presence daily renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And indeed, so soon as she was depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there was no more thoughts of her; and a thousand other Copies of Madam <hi>d'Olonne,</hi> which <hi>Paris</hi> is full of, caused that great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal to be forgotten in a short time.</p>

As soon as the Abbot <hi>le Camus</hi> saw them, knowing them to be very dissolute, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded <hi>Manchini</hi> to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> and that the next day, for that the World would say there had passed strange things amongst them: And <hi>Manchini</hi> that very evening declaring this design, <hi>Manicamp</hi> and the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> proposed to <hi>Vivonne</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire <hi>Bussy</hi> to come and pass two or three days without them, telling him that he was very capable to fill the place of the, other two: <hi>Vivonne</hi> having given his Consent, wrote a Letter to <hi>Bussy</hi> in all their names, that he was desired to quit for some time the hurry of the World, to come to them, that they might with the less distraction, give them selves up together to the thoughts of Eternity.

As he fancyed that a signe of a good will was a niceness for all works, he found nothing to his mind of all he saw, and usually he judged of Books without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and reason: In short, he was so blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with his own merit, that he saw none in any Body else; and to speak like himself, he had both a great deal of sufficiency, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:150088:134"/> a great deal of insufficiency; he was Bold in War, and fearfull in Love: And yet if any body would have believed him, he had his will of all the Women he had attempted; but the truth is he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by certain Ladies, who, till then had never refused any Man.</p>

This kind of behaviour made it thought that he had a passion for them; and it is certain that he had ever some sence of love in all
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:150088:135"/> the great intrigues he had had, he had been long in the Wars and had done good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but as in this Age it was not sufficient to be of a good Family, to have Wit, Courage, and have done great Services to procure Honours, with all these Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, he was got but half way of his fortune; he had not the baseness to flatter those people, whom <hi>Mazarine,</hi> the Soveraign Dispensour of Favours, put Confidence in, or had not been in a Condition to force them from him, by making him afraid, as most of the Marshals of his time had done.</p>

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:150088:136"/> Friends, but as the Number were but small, the Canticle was great and sharp, insomuch that should nothing be forgot, it would make a Volume: Part of the Night being spent in these rural Pleasures, they resolved to go to rest; Wherefore they left one another very much satisfied to see the progress they had begun to make in Devotion. <hi>Vivonne</hi> and <hi>Bussy</hi> being got up earlier the next morning than the others, went into <hi>Manicamps</hi> Chamber; but not having found him, and thinking he was gone a Walking in the Park, they went into the Count <hi>de Guiches</hi> Chambers, with whom they found him in Bed: <hi>You</hi> see My <hi>Friends,</hi> said <hi>Manicamp</hi> to them, <hi>that I endeavour to make good use of the things you spoke of yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day touching the Contempt of the world, I have already Won my self to despise the half, and I hope in short time, except it be my particular Friends, to have no great inclination for the other▪ we often Compass the same and by different me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,</hi> answered <hi>Bussy to</hi> him; <hi>for my part I do not Condemn your manners; Every one is saved after his own way; But I shall never take that course to be happy that you do.

               </head>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Savigny,</hi> continued he, has usually the finest Complexion ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, little sparkling Eyes, a flat Mouth but of a fine Colour; a lofty Forehead, a Nose only like it self, neither long nor little, broad at the end, and the same at the Middle, and all this which in particular is not handsome, take it altogether is very agreable: she is finely shaped and yet has no good Aire, she has a handsome Leg, her Neck her Armes and Hands are not well formed, her hair is white and thick, she has danced well, and has still a good Ear, she has an agreable Voice, and understands singing pretty well: as to the outside she is such as I have described her, no Woman has more Wit than she, and very few have so much: she has a diverting way with her, some say that for a Woman of Quality her Character is something too Wanton: In the time I saw her, I found this judgement ridiculous, and I know her <hi>Burlesque</hi> under the name of gayety; not seeing her at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, her Charmes do not dazle me; and I
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:150088:137"/> grant that she is too pleasant: If a Person has wit, and particularly of that kind of wit which will be free and merry, there needs no more than to see her, there is nothing lost with her: She understands you, comprehends exactly your meaning, she divines you, and usually leads you much farther than you think of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; sometimes you give her a mighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, the heat of pleasantry hurries her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and under those Circumstances she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives with joy all libertine expressions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they be finely wrapt up, &amp; keeps pace with her answers, and thinks it for her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to surpass all that can be said to her. It is no strange thing that you find not much discretion in a Person of so much fire; those two things being usually incompatible, and Nature cannot work Miracles in favour of her: A brisk Fool takes more with her than a wel-bred serious Man; the gaiety of People prepossesses her, that she shall be judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you understand what she says; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est mark of wit that can be given her, is to admire her. She loves Incense, she loves being beloved, and in order to that she loves that she may reap, she gives praise that she may receive it; she generally loves all men, of what Age, of what Birth, of what Merit, and what Profession soever they are, from the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Robe to the Frock, from the Scepter to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:150088:138"/> the Inkhorn; amongst Men she loves a Lover better than a Friend, and amongst Lovers the merry more than the sad; the Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flatter her Vanity, and the Brisk her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; she diverts herself with these, and flatters herself with an opinion that her Merit must be great, since she is able to make those others languish.</p>
               <p>She is of a cold temper, at least if we might believe her deceased Husband, and it was to it that he was obliged for her Vertue as he said; all her heat is in her will. The truth is it makes full recompence for the coldness of her temper; I believe that Conjugal Faith has not that violence if we consider the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is another thing to speak freely; I believe her Husband clear before Men, but I take him for a Cuckold before God. This fair One being willing to share in all diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements, has found a sure means, as she thinks, to take her Pleasures without injuring her Reputation in the least: She has contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Friendship with four or five pretended <hi>Lucretia</hi>'s, with whom she goes into all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces imaginable; she does not so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what she does, as with whom she is: By thus doing, she perswades herself that the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Company rectifies all her actions, and for my part, I fancy that the critical Minute, which is usually found with all women when
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:150088:138"/> only a Man and a Woman is together, would soonest be met with her in the midst of her Family. Sometimes she openly refuses a match of publick walking to establish herself in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the World in an Opinion of great regularity, and sometime after thinking her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self safe by so publick a refusal, she will make four or five matches of private walks; she has naturally a love for Pleasures; two things oblige her sometimes to deprive herself of them, Policy and Inequality; and it was for one of those two reasons that she goes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to a Sermon, the nex day after an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly. With some such publick Actions she thinks to prepossess all the World, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines that in doing a little good, and a little ill; all that can be said is, that one producing the other, she is a Civil Woman. The Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, which her little Court is full of, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her after another rate, they never fail to tell her, that it is impossible to reconcile Wisdom with the World, and Pleasure with Vertue, better than she does. To have Wit, and be of Quality, she suffers herself to be too much dazled with the grandeurs of Court; the day the Queen has spoken to her, &amp; perhaps only asked whom she came with, she will be so transported with joy, and a long time after she will find means to acquaint all those, whose respect she has a mind to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:150088:139"/> how obliginly the Queen spoke to her. The King having one Evening caused her to dance, and being returned to her place, which was near me; <hi>It must be confessed,</hi> said she to me, <hi>that the King has great Qualities, I believe, he will obscure the Glories of all his Predecssors.</hi> I could not forbear laughing in her face; and answering her, <hi>There is no doubt to be made of it, Madam, after what he had now done for you.</hi> She was then so satisfied with his Majesty, that I saw her upon the point of declaring her acknowledgment by saying, God bless the King.</p>
               <p>There are people who only let holy things put bounds to to their friendship, and who would do all for their Friends ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept offending God. These people call themselves Friends to the very Altars: the friendship of Madam <hi>de Sevigny</hi> has others Limits, that fair one is only a friend as far as the purse; There was never any pretty Woman but she in the World, that disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored her self by ingratitude; she must needs be much afraid of necessity, since to avoid only the shadow of it, she is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive of shame. Those who would excuse her say that she has too much regard to the Counsell of people, who know what hunger is, and who still remember their poverty: Whether this humour proceeds
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:150088:139"/> from others or from her self, nothing is so natural as what appears in her Oeconomy.</p>
               <p>The greatest application that Madam <hi>de Sevigny</hi> has is to seem what she is not; since she has studied that Course, she has already learnt to deceive those who had no great acquaintance with her: but as there are people who have interessed themselves in her more than others, they have unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately for her perceived and discovered, that all is not Gold that glisters.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Sevigny</hi> is unequal to the very Balls of her Eyes and to her Eye-lids; her Eyes are of different Colours, and the Eyes being the mirours of the Soul, these irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities are as a mark that nature gives to those who come near her not to rely much upon her kindness.</p>
               <p>I know not if it is that her Armes are not very handsome, that she is not very tender of them, or that she does not think it a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, the thing being so general; but in short who will may take and kiss them, I fancy that it is sufficient to perswade her that there is no ill in it, that she belives they take no pleasure in it. Nothing but Custome can now constrain her, but she will not stick to show it rather than Men well knowing, that having made modes when they pleased Civility is no longer included in such narrow Bounds.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:150088:140"/>
               <p>This is, my Dear, the Picture of Madam <hi>de Sevigny:</hi> her estate which would have been a great help to mine and had belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our family, obliged my Father to design I should marry her; But tho I was so well acquainted with her then, as I am at present, I did not answer my Fathers design, certain loose Courses I saw her take made me apprehensive; And I found her the prettyest Creature imaginable to be the Wise of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This sentiment helped me mightily from marrying her; But as she was married a short time after me, I fell in love with her, and the strongest reason that obliged me to make her my Mistress, was that which had hindred me from desiring to be her Husband.</p>
               <p>As I was her near Relation, I had a very great access to her House, and I saw the vexations her husband daily gave her, she complained thereof very often to me, and desired me to make him ashamed of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand ridiculous inclinations he had: I ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her in this very happily for some time; but at length her Husbands nature being too strong for my Counsels, after some delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it came into my head to be in love with her, more through the Conveniency of the Coniuncture, than through the force of my inclination. Insomuch that <hi>Sevigny</hi> having one day told me that he had passed the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:150088:140"/> Night before the most agreable imaginably, not only as to himself, but the Lady with whom he had spent it. <hi>You may believe,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he, <hi>that it was not with your Cosin; it was with</hi> Ninon. <hi>So much the worse for you,</hi> said I to him; <hi>my Cosin is a thousand times a finer Woman than she, and I am sure if she was not your Wife, you would make her your Mistress. All this may be,</hi> answered he: <hi>I had no sooner left him then that I went to give him an account of all to Madam</hi> de Sevigny. <hi>This is a fine thing to brag of,</hi> said she to me blushing for vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Do not you seem to know any thing of it,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered I, <hi>for you see the Consequence? I think you are a fool,</hi> replyed she, <hi>to give me that advice, or that you take me for one. You would certainly be so, Madam,</hi> replyed I, <hi>if you do not pay him in his own Coin, or if you should tell him again what I have told you: Take revenge, my fair Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin, I will go halves with you in your Vengeance; for in short, your Interests are as dear to me as my own. Hold, good my Lord,</hi> said she to me, <hi>I am not so vexed as you imagine: Having met with</hi> Sevigny <hi>the next day at the Court, he came to me into my Coach; as soon as he was in, I fancy,</hi> said he to me, <hi>that you told your Cosin what I yesterday acquainted you with of</hi> Ninon, <hi>because she has hinted something of it to me: I,</hi> replyed I, <hi>I have not spoke to her; but as she has a great deal of Wit, she has said to me so many
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:150088:141"/> things upon the point of jealousie, that she some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hits at the truth.</hi> Sevigny <hi>being satisfied with so good a reason, fell to dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I repeated to him what I had told him a thousand times, that tho his Wife was discreet, he might at length, by the continuation of his actions, so provoke her, that some welbred Man coming to fall in love with in the time he played her such pranks, she might perhaps seek for in the sweets of Love and in Vengeance, what she would not have thought of in love alone; and thereupon being parted, I went home; and wrote this Letter to his Wife.</hi>

                  <hi>Six Months after</hi> Sevigny <hi>was killed in a Duel by the Chevalier</hi> d' Albert, <hi>his Wife seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inconsolable for his death; the reasons she had to hate him being known by all the World, they fancied that her grief was only feigned. For my part, who had more familiarity with her than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I did not wait so long as they to speak to her of agreeable things; and presently after I made love to her, but without Ceremonies, and as if I had never done nothing else: She made me one of her Oracle answers, which Women make usually in the beginning, that my Passion was so much at rest, that it made me appear but little favourable, and perhaps it might be so, I know not. Tho Madam</hi> de Sevigny <hi>had no intention to love, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to have more Complaisance for her than I had in that Encounter. However, as I was her near Relation on the most honourable side, she made me a thousand proffers to be her Friend, and for my part, finding in her a sort of Wit which diverted me, I was not sorry to be so. I saw her almost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, I wrote to her, I made love to her after a raillying way, I fell out with my nearest Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to serve with my Credit and Estate those
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:150088:142"/> persons she recommended to me. In short, if she had occasion for all I have in the World, I should have thought my self extreamly obliged to her if she would have given me an occasion of assisting her. As my Friendship was pretty like love, Madam</hi> de Sevigny <hi>was very well satisfied as long as I did not love elsewhere: but Chance, as I shall tell you in the Sequel, having made me fall in love with Madam</hi> de Preey, <hi>my Cosin, she did not show me so much affection as she had done, when she thought that I loved nothing but her. From time to time we had little quarrels, which indeed were made up, but which left in my heart, and I believe in hers, such seeds of Division for the first occasion we should both have, and which were even capable to imbitter indifferent things. In short, an occasion being offered, wherein I had need of Madam</hi> de Sevigny, <hi>and wherein with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her assistance I was in danger of losing my Fortune, this ungrateful Woman abandoned me, and did me in Friendship the greatest infidelity in the World. This, my Dear, made me fall out with her, and far from sacrificing her to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> de Monglas, <hi>as was reported: This Lady whom I had long been in love with, hindred me from having all the resentment which such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude deserved. Bussy</hi> having done speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Vivonne</hi> told him all that was said of the Count <hi>de Lude,</hi> and of Madam <hi>de Sevigny; Was he ever much in her favour?</hi> Before I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:150088:143"/> to that, replyed <hi>Bussy,</hi> it is necessary I give you an account of this Count <hi>de Lude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He has a little ugly Face, a great head of Hair, a fine Shape; he was not born to be sat; but the fear of being incommode and disagreable, makes him take such extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary care to be lean, that at length he has ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected his design; his fine Shape has indeed cost him something of his health, he has spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his stomack in the Summer by the Dyets he has taken, and the Vinegar he has made use of. He is active on Horseback, he dances and fences well, which is brave; he fought very well with <hi>Vardes,</hi> and they do him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, when they suspect his Valour, the ground of this slander is, that all the Sparks of his Circumstances, having ingaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the War, he would needs make one Campaign as a Voluntier; but the reason of this was, that he is idle, and loves his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; In a word, he has Courage and no Ambition, he has a soft Wit, he is pleasing with Women, he has ever been well used by them, but does not love them long; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that he is so happy in their favours are, besides the reputation he has of being secret, his good Meen, and his being well provided for love Engagements▪ but that which makes him so successful every where is, that he cries when he will, and nothing perswades Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:150088:143"/> so much that we are in love as tears. However whether some mischance has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him in his intrigues, or that these who Envy say that it is his fault they have no Children, he does not much dishonour the Women he has to do with. Madam <hi>de Sevigny</hi> is one of those for whom he has had a love; but his passion ending then when that fair one begun to make returnes to it; Thus Cross accidents have saved her, their passions could never meet. And as he has ever visited her since, tho without applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it has occasioned the report that he has had to do with her. And tho it is not true, there is great likehood it was so. He has however been the weakside of Madam <hi>de Savigny,</hi> and the Man for whom she has had the most inclination, notwithstanding the jeasts she had made of it: this puts me in mind of a Song she made wherein she causes Madam <hi>de Sourdis</hi> who was with Child to speak after this manner.</p>

They went to dinner, which having done with the usual merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they went into the Park, where they were no sooner come, that they desired <hi>Bussy</hi> to relate to them the story of Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> and his Amours, which having granted them, he begun after this manner.</p>

               <head>The History of Madam <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas</hi> and of <hi>Bussy.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FIve years before Madam <hi>de Sevigny's</hi> and my falling out, being at <hi>Paris</hi> in the beginning of Winter, and much a friend to <hi>Feuillade</hi> and <hi>Darcy,</hi> it came into all our heads to be in love, and because that we were not willing that our affairs should part us from one another, we cast our Eyes upon all the pretty Women, to see if we could find three who were as much friends as we were, or who might come to be so: we sought a long time without meeting with what we wanted. The Ladies of <hi>Mong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, Precy</hi> and <hi>L' Isle</hi> were very much friends and very lovely; but as perhaps we should have been troubled to have agreed upon the the Choice, and that the Merit of those Ladies was not so equall, that our inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions should Carry us to love them equally, we agreed to make three tickets of their three names, and to put them into a purse, and to keep to her that fate should give us in drawing them. Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> fell to <hi>Feuillade's</hi> share Madam <hi>de L' Isle</hi> to <hi>Darcy</hi> and Madam <hi>de Precy</hi> to me: Fortune in this occasion shewed how blind she is▪ for she
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:150088:145"/> did a favour to <hi>Feuillade</hi> which he knew not so well the value of as I did; but I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be contented with what she had given me: And as I had seen Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> but five or six times, I fancyed that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications I was going to make to Madam <hi>de Precy</hi> would efface out of my mind the beginning of a Passion.</p>
               <p>We thereupon made our Addresses to our Mistresses, <hi>la Feuillade</hi> having for a Fortnight or three Weeks, made love to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Montglas</hi> by assiduities, resolved at length to make her a Declaration. At first he found her a Woman, who without being too severe, seemed to him so natural an Enemy of Engagements, that he almost despaired of effecting his designs with her, or at least of effecting them suddenly: Yet he was not quite disencouraged, and sometime after he sound her more uncertain, and in short he pressed her so much, and seemed to her so much in love, that she gave him leave to hope being beloved one day: But before I speak further, it is convenient that I describe to you Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> and <hi>Feuillade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> has little black spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Eys, an agreable Mouth, a Nose some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing turned up, fine white Teeth, a too lively Complexion, fine and delicate Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and a pleasing turn of Countenance;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:150088:145"/> her Hair is black, long and thick; she is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream neat, and the Air that comes from her is purer then that she breathes; she has the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Neck imaginable, her Arms and Hands delicately shaped, she is neither great nor little, but of so easie a shape, that it will be ever agreable, if she can save it from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency of too much fat. Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> has a quick and penetrating Wit, like her Complexion, even to excess; she speaks and writes with a surprizing Facility, and the most naturally imaginable; her thoughts are often diverted elsewhere in Conversation, and you cannot say to her things of so great Consequence, as to take up all her attention; she desires you some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to tell her something she had then a mind to know; and as you begin your Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, she forgets her Curiosity, and the fire, she is full of, makes her interrupt you to speak of something else.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> loves Musick and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, she makes very pretty ones her self, she sings the best of any Woman in <hi>France,</hi> of her Quality; no Body dances better than she, she fears Solitude, she is a true Friend, even to take the part of those she loves with indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and to the very giving them all her Estate, if they have occasion for it: She keeps their Secrets, religiously; she knows
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:150088:146"/> very well how to converse with the World; she is as Civil as a Woman of Quality ought to be: And tho she is not willing to displease any Body, her Civility has more of Pride than Flattery; for which reason she does not gain hearts so soon as several others that are more insinuating: But when they know her sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness, they apply themselves much more earnestly to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>La Feuillade</hi> is not altogether for a Man what Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> is for a Woman; their Merits are different; he has however some false Charms, with which the weak are at first dazled, but which never deceives such People as make Reflections; he has blew lively Eyes, a great Mouth, a short Nose, fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled Hair, and something reddish; his Shape is pretty good, his Knees turn inwards, he has too much vivacity, he speaks much, and will alway be pleasant, but he does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do what he has a mind to, that is to say, with civil Persons, fancy to the populace and meanest Wits, with whom there needs no more than to have always the Mouth open to laugh or to speak; he is admirable; he has a light wit, and a hard heart, even to ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; he is envious, and it is to him an affront, to be in prosperity; he is vain and haughty, and at his first coming to Court, he had so often told us that he was brave, that he made
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:150088:146"/> a Conscience of suspecting it; however at present we make a Conscience of believing it.</p>
               <p>I have told you that Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> being perswaded that he had a violent Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for her, gave him hopes of being beloved. Any other than <hi>Feuillade</hi> would have made of this business the most agreable Intrigue i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable; but he was lodged as I have told you, and only loved by starts; he did enough to heat his Mistress, and too little to engage her. When I told that fair One that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her extreamly, because that <hi>Feuillade</hi> had desired me before her, to speak for him in his absence, she drolled upon me, and made me observe some parts of his procedure, which destroyed the good Offices I would have done him. I did not fail to excuse him, &amp; not being able to save his Conduct, I justified at least his intentions. We were much upon these terms, <hi>Darcy</hi> and I with the Ladies of <hi>Precy</hi> and <hi>L' Isle,</hi> that is to say, they were willing that we should love them, but indeed we did our Devoir better with them, than <hi>Feuillade</hi> did with Madam <hi>de Monglas;</hi> in short, three Months being spent, during which that fair One found herself more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by the things I had said to her in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Feuillade,</hi> than by the love he had shown her; this Lover was forced to go serve in the Army with a Regiment of Foot he
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:150088:147"/> had. This Farewel made her sensible that she had something more kindness in her heart for <hi>la Feuillade</hi> then she had thitherto belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: She let him perceive something of it; but tho it was enough to render a welbred Man happy, it could not shock the severest Vertue. <hi>Feuillade</hi> at parting made her a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Protestations of loving her as long as he lived, tho she should even continue ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately resolved not to make any returns to his Passion; and he and I pressed her so much to give him leave to write to her that she gave her consent.</p>
               <p>Sometime before his departure, perceiving that the Commerce I had had for my Friend with his Mistress, had the more touched my heart for her, in making me the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her, and that the efforts I had made to love Madam <hi>de Precy,</hi> had not cured me of my budding Passion for Madam <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas.</hi> I resolved not to see her so often▪ that I might not be divided between Honour and Self-love. As long as <hi>Feuillade</hi> was at <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ris,</hi> his Mistress did not take notice that I did not visit her so often as I used to do; but when he was gone, she perceived a Change in my way of living, and this put her in pain, thinking that my retreat was a sign of <hi>Feuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade</hi>'s being become indifferent, and of whom likewise she had not had any tidings since his
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:150088:147"/> departure. Some days after having sent to desire me to come to her; <hi>What have I done to you, my Lord,</hi> said she to me, <hi>that I see you no oftner; has our Friendship any share in your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence? No, Madam,</hi> said I to her, <hi>it only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects my self. How,</hi> said she, <hi>have I given you any reason to Complain? No, Madam,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed I, <hi>I can only complain of Fortune.</hi> The disorder with which I said this, obliged her to press me to tell her more▪ <hi>How!</hi> added she, <hi>do you conceal your Affairs from me, whom I let see all I have in my heart? if it be so I should complain of you. Ah! how pressing are you▪</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered I her, <hi>is it discretion to force a Secret from ones Friend? ought not you to believe that I should not tell you mine; since I do not tell it you in the Circumstances I am in with you, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought not you to divine it, Madam, since—Ah! do not proceed,</hi> interrupted she, <hi>I am afraid to understand you, I am afraid of having reason to be angry, and of losing the esteem I have for you: No, no, Madam,</hi> said I to her, <hi>be not afraid, I am under those Circumstances you are not willing I should be, and yet I shall not be wanting in my Devoir; but since we are come so far, I will tell you all the rest: As soon as I saw you, Madam, I found you very amiable, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time I saw you afterwards, I thought you more beautiful than the time before; however, I was not yet sensible of any thing so pressing as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:150088:148"/> me to follow you up and down, but I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much pleased when I met with you. The first thing which made me perceive that I was in love with you, Madam, was the trouble your absence gave me; and as I was upon the point of aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning my self to my Passion, and of thinking of the means of making it known to you,</hi> Darcy, Feuillade, <hi>and I, drew lots, whom we should each of us make our address to, of you. Madam</hi> de Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>and Madam</hi> de L'Isle, <hi>tho what my heart was sensible of for you, Madam, was yet very weak, I should not have left to chance a thing of that Consequence, if I had not been thitherto ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lucky; but in short, my Fortune changed in that occasion, for you fell to</hi> Feuillade'<hi>s share, and I should have gained more by having lost all my life time, than in that unhappy moment; all my Comfort was, as I have said, that the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I was going to make to Madam</hi> de Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>whom I had formerly loved, would root out of my heart what was budding there, but all to no purpose, Madam; you may judge that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce that the interest of my Friend obliged me to have with you, giving me▪ the opportunity of knowing you more particularly, and of observing in you admirable principles for Love, I could not get rid of a Passion which your Beauty alone had produced, when</hi> Feuillade <hi>desired me to serve him; I felt something beyond the joy we have usually in serving our Friends, and I quickly perceived
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:150088:148"/> afterwards, that without designing to betray him, I was overjoyed with being concerned in his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, to have only the pleasure of seeing you more nearly, but at length it put me into terrible pains; this, Madam, has obliged me to see you less fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and tho you did not take notice of it, but since</hi> Feuillade'<hi>s departure, it is above a fortnight since I retrenched my Visits. Not but that you must have observed, Madam, that I have served my Friend as I would have served my self, I have sometimes justified him when he was apparently Culpable, and I might if I had had a mind, have ruined him with you without seeming unfaithful, leaving it to be done by the resentment of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Faults which you pretended he committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Love he shewed you. But I confess that my Duty makes me suffer extreamly in seeing you, and were I out of your sight, it would spare me a great many efforts I make upon you my self: besides, Madam, I would never have told you the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of my retreat, if you had not asked me them. Nothing can be more civil, my Lord,</hi> Madam de Monglas replyed to me, <hi>than what you now do; but you ought to compleat your Duty, and send your Friend an account of all things; that he may not be surprized when he shall learn perhaps by other means, that you hardly ever see me, and that he may not to no purpose rely on your good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to me:</hi> And thereupon Madam <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas</hi> having caused Ink and Paper to be brought, I wrote this Letter.</p>

               <p>As soon as I had received these two Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I went to carry them to Madam <hi>de Monglas;</hi> but not to injure my friends whose Mistress was very Nice, I efforced all the end of the Letter he wrote to me, from that part where he tells me, that tho the Merit of Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> should have so blinded me that I should not be in a Condition to retire, upon the necessity there was of lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her: When she was well acquainted with, I was afraid she would think, as well as I, that that part was very gallant, but not very passionate. <hi>You are in the right</hi> answered the Count <hi>de Guiche, and not only that part but both the Letters seem to me well written, but</hi> show the person indifferent. <hi>The sequel,</hi> replyed <hi>Bussy, will not undeceive you.</hi>

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:150088:150"/> Visits to me, I give you my Consent; but my Lord it is upon Condition you never speak to me of the sentiments you have for me. I will not, since you are so pleased,</hi> replied I; <hi>Not but that I ought to speak of it, without being suspected by you; for tho I love you more than I do my life, if to a knowledge my love you should despise that of my friend, in ceasing to esteem you, I should likewise cease loving you; The reason why I love you, Madam, is I assure you, not for that you are beautifull, but because you are also no Cocquet. I beleive you, my Lord,</hi> said she to me, <hi>but since you neither desire nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend nothing, love me no longer; for what is a love without desires and hopes? I pretended to Nothing,</hi> said I to her, <hi>but I hope and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire: And what can you desire, replied she? I desire,</hi> replied I, <hi>that</hi> la Feuillade <hi>should leave off loving you; and that it should be indifferent to you. And in case that should be,</hi> said she, <hi>should you think to be the more happy? I know not if I should be so, Madam</hi> said I to her, <hi>but at least I should be nearer happiness than I am.</hi> And thereupon I made this Song.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Since only loving you I find</l>

               <p>What gave me some Comfort in the Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of all the pains that an Amour without hopes is attended with, is that I was upon the Point of having the charge of Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Horse, and that this Charge ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging me to go suddainly to the Army, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would Cure me of an unfortunate pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Some days before my departure, I was willing to do divers the trouble I had through the violence I used upon my self to Conceal my passion, and for that end I gave Madam <hi>de Savigny</hi> a very fine and extraordinary treat which you will certeinly be well pleased to have the description of.</p>
               <p>First, figure to your self in the Garden of the Temple which you know, a Wood, wherein two Allyes cross in the place they meet, there was a great Oval of Trees, on whose Branches a hundred Christal Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks were tyed; on one side of this Oval was a magnificent Theater raised, whose De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coration well deserved to be so lighted as it was, and the lustre of a thousand Wax Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, which the leaves of the Trees hindred from spreading, rendred so bright a light in that part, that the Sun could not have given more, and for the same reason all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout was so obscure that your Eys were of no use: The Calmest Night imaginable; as soon as the Play was begun it was found very
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:150088:151"/> pleasant: After this Divertisement, four and twenty Violins having played a Consort, played likewise Brawls, Courants, and Country Dances; the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was not so great as it was well chosen; some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, others looked upon the Dancers, and others, whose Intrigues were more forward, walked with their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses in the Allyes, where they sported without see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another. This lasted till day, and as if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had acted in Concert with me, the morning began to appear when the light went out: This Feat suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded so well, that Letters were sent to all places of the Particulars of it, and it is still talked of with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; some fancied that Madam <hi>de Sevigny</hi> was in that Occasion only the Pretext of Madam <hi>de Precy;</hi> but the truth was, I gave that Treat to Madam <hi>de Monglas,</hi> without daring to tell her so; and I believe that she suspected, without letting me know her thoughts. In the mean time I toyed with her before people, I was ever saying to her a thousand kind things in a drolling way; and I made this Song to a Sarabrand Tune, which you have certainly heard Sung.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>All those who see you, do you adore,</l>
                  <l>But tho your Eyes do all things charme,</l>
                  <l>It is requir'd you should deplore,</l>
                  <l>And of your Coyness your self disarm.</l>
                  <l>Designs upon your heart I laid</l>
                  <l>To lose my own, I thought was fine;</l>
                  <l>But fair <hi>Beliza,</hi> I'me afraid</l>
                  <l>Your heart is harder much than mine.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>You may judge, that having these Sentiments for Madam <hi>de Monglas,</hi> my Addresses to Madam <hi>de Precy,</hi> were not very extraordinary: I lived with her with the greatest ease imaginable, and my little eagerness suted extreamly well with her lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. However, when she begun to suspect that I was
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:150088:152"/> in love with Madam <hi>de Monglas,</hi> her Passion for me begun to be inflamed: I thereupon admired the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prichio's of Ladies; they are vexed to lose a Lover, tho they are not willing to love them; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this, what Madam <hi>de Precy</hi> did was not so surprizing, as the Actions of Madam <hi>d' Le Isle;</hi> I had made love to the first, and it was not strange that she took some interest therein; but for Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> whom I had never shown any thing but a Friendship to, I cannot sufficiently wonder at the course she took, which was thus: So soon as she suspected my Passion for Madam <hi>de Monglas,</hi> she used all manner of Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sices to be perfectly informed of it; she told me sometimes after a drolling way, that I was in love with her; sometimes she spoke well of her; and because I feared she would thereby discover the secret of my heart, I was sufficiently reserved in my Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; at other times she would speak ill of her, and for my part, being willing to acquaint Madam <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas,</hi> that she was not to rely upon the Friendship of Madam <hi>de' L' Isle,</hi> having found her in a thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Occasions betraying Madam <hi>de Monglas,</hi> I set her talk, and gave her a very favourable Audience, to make her believe I took pleasure in it: At length, not being able one Evening to suffer the Rage she was in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her, I gave Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> notice of it, which occasioned their falling out; and in the Sequel, this fair One had all the reasons imaginable to believe I had a real Passion for her.</p>
